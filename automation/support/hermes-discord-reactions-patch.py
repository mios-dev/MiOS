"""In-place patch of gateway/platforms/discord.py to add progressive
"thinking" reactions on the operator's Discord message during agent
processing.

Operator directive "also add more reactions to the
MiOS-Hermes Discord bot--Should be using more discord reactions to
show it's thinking!"

Upstream hermes-agent's Discord gateway emits exactly two reactions:
  on_processing_start    -> 👀 (single "looking" emoji)
  on_processing_complete -> ✅ / ❌

That gives the operator no visibility into what stage the agent is in
mid-run. This patch enriches the reaction surface with a progressive
sequence:
    📡 (received)          immediate
    🧠 (thinking)          after 2s if still processing
    🛠️ (using tools)       after 8s if still processing
    ⏳ (still working)      after 20s if still processing
    ✅ / ❌ (final)         on completion (and all phase reactions
                            are cleared first so the final outcome
                            stands alone)

A background asyncio.create_task() drives the progression so the
gateway's normal flow isn't blocked. The task is stashed on the
gateway instance keyed by Discord message id so concurrent
in-flight messages each get their own task that the matching
on_processing_complete can cancel.

Idempotent: rerunning is a no-op once the marker comment is present.
Safe: if Discord's add_reaction / remove_reaction fail (rate limit,
missing perm), each call already swallows the exception in the
existing _add_reaction / _remove_reaction helpers, so the progression
degrades silently.
