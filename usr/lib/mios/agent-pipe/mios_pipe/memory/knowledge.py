# AI-hint: Tiered pgvector KNOWLEDGE memory subsystem extracted verbatim from server.py (refactor R6 wave).

"""Tiered pgvector KNOWLEDGE memory: store + recency-weighted recall + eviction.

Extracted verbatim from ``server.py``. The store/recall/evict functions are
unchanged; ``server.py`` re-imports every name under its original alias so the
public surface is byte-identical. Pure eviction SQL/plan logic lives in
``mios_evict``; the Postgres+pgvector client is ``mios_pg``; the write-time
memory-poisoning scan is ``mios_memguard``. Every server-side runtime helper,
request contextvar and ``KNOWLEDGE_*``/``EMB_*`` config constant the moved code
reads is dependency-injected via :func:`configure` (one-way module boundary --
this module never imports ``server``).
