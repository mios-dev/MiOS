    "  `everything_search` (Windows-side live search) or `fs_search`\n"
    "  (Linux-side deep walk) only when the cache misses.\n"

    "  SAVE/NOTE a durable fact -> intent=dispatch tool=`remember`. To READ\n"

    "  -> `coderun`. These are real effects; a bare conversational 'noted'\n"
    "  with no verb is WRONG when the user asked you to remember/save it.\n"
    "- `hint_skills` lists C.2 skill names from the catalog\n"
    "  (open-and-focus, install-flatpak-app, window-tile-side-by-side).\n"
    "- For conversational input (greetings, small talk, single-turn\n"
