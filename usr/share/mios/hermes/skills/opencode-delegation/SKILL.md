# opencode — the coding specialist /v1 council peer

opencode (the SST/charm coding agent binary at
`/usr/lib/mios/agents/opencode/bin/opencode`) runs behind an OpenAI
`/v1` gateway (`mios-opencode-gateway.service`, loopback `:8633`,
SSOT slot `[ports].opencode_gateway`). It is registered in the swarm
as `[agents.opencode]` — a **peer agent on the same OpenAI contract
as you (Hermes :8642)**, dispatched by the agent-pipe orchestrator
(`:8640`), NOT a sub-process spawned over ACP/stdio.

This is the current model. The retired model spawned opencode via
Hermes's native `delegate_task(acp_command="opencode")` — that path
is gone. You no longer spawn opencode; the orchestrator dispatches
code-heavy facets to the opencode peer in parallel with you, and
folds its answer into the council synthesis. Same Ollama backend
(`mios-opencode:latest`), so no extra VRAM contention.

## What routes to the opencode peer

The orchestrator's swarm decomposition sends these facets to opencode
because its native discipline beats a generic sibling:

* **Multi-file refactors / renames / moves** — opencode's `edit` +
  `patch` tools do string-replace + unified-diff with snapshot
  rollback.
* **"Read N files, edit M files" loops** — its `read` + `glob` +
  `grep` + `edit` chain is purpose-built; it caches reads and
  presents diffs before applying.
* **Code-aware PC-control workflows** — "look at this script + edit
  the config + retry": opencode's session model + snapshot history
  outperform ad-hoc terminal calls.
* **Long-running coding work** with rollback guarantees — its
  `Snapshot.Service` captures filesystem state per session.

## Your part as a council peer

You and opencode run as siblings in the same council. When a turn is
code-heavy, the orchestrator engages the opencode peer alongside you —
you don't call it, you collaborate. Concretely:

* **Don't grind heavy multi-file code work yourself** with qwen
  children when the opencode peer is engaged — it has the better
  tools for it. Focus your effort on orchestration, system actions,
  comms, and synthesis.
* **You still own** single-shot file reads/edits via your own `file`
  tool, one-line `terminal` commands, and the MiOS surface
  (`mios-find`, window launch, verbs/skills/recipes) — opencode
  doesn't know about those; they are YOUR direct tools.
* **Parallel non-code fan-out** still uses your native
  `delegate_task(tasks=[...])` to qwen3:1.7b children — that
  mechanism is unchanged and separate from the opencode peer.

## Operator's mental model

Operator sees one MiOS answer. Under the hood, for code work the
opencode /v1 peer did the read/edit/patch + snapshot discipline in
parallel and the council synthesised the result. Per the operator's
integration direction: "Hermes is the lifestyle / orchestration
agent, opencode is the specialist coding agent" — now wired as
co-equal /v1 council peers rather than a parent/child ACP spawn.
