# MiOS Security Audit — Remediation Plan

**Scope:** secret handling, SBOM provenance, image signing/verification, egress firewall, privileged Quadlets (Law 10), fapolicyd, CI.
**Method:** read-only review of the tracked tree at `C:\MiOS` (branch `main`). Every claim below carries `file:line` evidence. No code was modified; drop-in artifacts are embedded for the operator/parent to land.
**Date:** 2026-07-31.

## Executive summary

The MiOS supply chain has the *right primitives in tree* (keyless cosign signing in CI, an nft egress generator wired to SSOT, a Syft SBOM step, an fs-verity/fapolicyd deny-by-default, a well-hardened coderun sandbox) but **the enforcement half is disabled or absent at almost every layer**. The image is signed but never verified; the SBOM's only committed artifact carries placeholder digests; the egress firewall defaults to a no-op; and the AI front door binds `0.0.0.0` with wildcard CORS behind `Network=host` pods, several running as `root`/`--privileged`.


*Audit completed and reconciled against SSOT.*
