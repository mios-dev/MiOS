## Purpose -- where RPMs sit in the whole system

MiOS is one thing built two ways at once: an **immutable, bootc/OCI-shaped
Fedora workstation** (the entire OS is a single container image -- boot it,
`bootc upgrade` it like a `git pull`, `bootc rollback` it like a Ctrl-Z) that is
*also* a **local, self-replicating, agentic AI operating system** (local LLM
inference lanes, an OpenAI-compatible front door, a multi-agent orchestration
pipeline, and a PostgreSQL+pgvector memory, all on your own hardware).

This document describes the **bottom layer** of that system: the RPM packages
baked into the image at build time. They are the *irreducible host substrate* --
the kernel, drivers, runtimes, daemons, and admin tooling that everything else
stands on. The GPU stack here is what lets the AI inference lanes and the
passthrough VMs each claim hardware via CDI; the container runtime here is what
runs the agent Quadlets; the security daemons here are what keep the agent plane
sandboxed. Without this substrate there is no image to ship, no bootc lifecycle
to carry it forward, and no place for the agent stack to live.

So the RPM surface is deliberately *minimal*: it exists only to make the three
higher delivery formats (Flatpak / Container / VM) function. Applications, AI
services, and guest workloads are **not** RPMs here -- see the Delivery Policy
below. This file is the human-readable rationale for *why* each substrate
package is present; the machine-readable source of truth is `mios.toml`.

---

## SSOT is mios.toml (PACKAGES.md is documentation only)

**This file is documentation, not the source of truth.** As of MiOS
v0.2.4 (2026-05-05) the legacy fenced ```packages-<section>```
fallback has been **removed from the runtime path entirely**. The
definitive package surface lives in `mios.toml [packages.<section>].pkgs`,
resolved through the layered overlay chain (highest precedence first):

```
$MIOS_TOML override                build-time staging only
~/.config/mios/mios.toml           per-user override
/etc/mios/mios.toml                host/admin override
/ctx/mios-bootstrap/mios.toml      bootstrap-side override (build-time)
/usr/share/mios/mios.toml          vendor defaults
/ctx/usr/share/mios/mios.toml      build context (during OCI build)
```

To add, remove, or replace packages, edit the matching
`[packages.<section>]` table in any layer. The bootstrap entry
(`mios-bootstrap/mios.toml`) is the canonical user-edit copy --
operators can ship a single-file deployment override without
touching mios.git. The HTML configurator at
`/usr/share/mios/configurator/mios.html` is the operator-facing
editor for the same TOML.

`automation/lib/packages.sh` reads exclusively from the TOML chain.
This file remains under `usr/share/doc/mios/reference/PACKAGES.md`
as a human-readable reference for *why* each package is in MiOS --
the prose between sections is the documentation; the fenced lists
are the quickly-reviewable summary. Keep both in sync as a courtesy
to readers, but only mios.toml affects what dnf actually installs.

---

## DELIVERY POLICY (project-wide invariant)

Every software artifact in MiOS ships as **one of three formats**, and the
choice of format is what keeps the immutable-image promise intact: apps stay
sandboxed and user-replaceable, services stay isolated and version-locked to the
image, and guest OSes stay fully contained.

| Format | What goes here | Where it's defined |
|---|---|---|
| **Flatpak** | User-facing applications (GUI apps, games, IDEs, file managers, terminal emulators, viewers, editors, gaming clients, virt GUIs). | `mios-bootstrap/mios.toml` `[desktop].flatpaks` → `MIOS_FLATPAKS` build-arg → `/usr/lib/mios/env.d/flatpaks.env` → `mios-flatpak-install` at first boot. |
| **Container** (Quadlet / Podman / Distrobox) | Long-lived services and isolated workloads (the local AI plane -- `mios-llm-light`, the gated `mios-llm-heavy`/`mios-llm-heavy-alt` lanes, `mios-pgvector`, `mios-open-webui`, `mios-searxng`; plus Forgejo, Ceph daemons, k3s workloads, NUT). | `etc/containers/systemd/*.container` (Quadlet) or `usr/share/distrobox/`. |
| **VM** (libvirt / QEMU) | Heavyweight guest workloads needing a full guest OS (Windows guests, legacy distros, hardware-emulation testbeds). | Driven by libvirt/QEMU from the host substrate. |

**RPM (this file)** is reserved strictly for the **irreducible host
substrate** — the minimum set required for the three delivery formats
above to function. That means: kernel + drivers + firmware, boot
tooling, init / PID-1, system libraries, system daemons, the runtimes
themselves (Podman/bootc, Flatpak/portals, libvirt/QEMU), display-
server foundation, host-scope security daemons, filesystem drivers,
core CLI admin tools, and image-build toolchain.

**Before adding any RPM to this file:** ask "is this an app, a service,
or a guest workload?" If yes to any, it does NOT belong here — route
it to the appropriate Flatpak / Container / VM channel above. Repos
in `automation/05-enable-external-repos.sh` follow the same rule:
no application RPM repos (the VSCodium repo was removed for this
reason).

**SECUREBOOT NOTE:** Proprietary NVIDIA drivers are included as
essential RPM artifacts for Microsoft-compliant SecureBoot verification.
Steam ships exclusively as a Flatpak (`com.valvesoftware.Steam`).

# 'MiOS' v0.2.4 -- Package Manifest

This file is the human-readable rationale for the RPM substrate; the
machine-readable **single source of truth** is `mios.toml`
`[packages.<section>].pkgs`, parsed by `automation/lib/packages.sh`.
To add a package, add it to the appropriate `[packages.<section>]` table
in `mios.toml`. Apps go in `mios.toml` `[desktop].flatpaks`; long-lived
services go in `etc/containers/systemd/`.

(The fenced ```packages-<section>``` blocks below mirror the TOML sections for
quick review. Since v0.2.4 they are documentation only and no longer parsed at
build time.)

**CHANGELOG v0.2.0:**
- Standardized versioning across the entire stack.
- Added uupd (unified updater replacing bootc-fetch-apply-updates.timer)
- Added greenboot + greenboot-default-health-checks (auto-rollback on boot failure)
- Added cosign (signed image verification for `bootc switch --enforce-container-sigpolicy`)
- Added toolbox (companion to existing distrobox)
- Added kubectl, helm (client tooling; k3s binary still from rancher install)
- Added podman-plugins, podman-docker, containers-common
- Added nvidia-container-selinux (missing SELinux policy for toolkit on bootc)
- Added steam-devices (udev rules for controllers)
- Added aide, openscap-scanner, scap-security-guide, libpwquality, setools-console, nftables (security)
- Added cloud-init, wslu, python3-pip, libei (Podman-machine + WSL + desktop input)
- Added freerdp, freerdp-libs, virt-viewer, qemu-device-display-virtio-gpu (remote/display)
- NEW SECTION: packages-updater (uupd + greenboot) wired into 43-uupd-installer.sh
- Fix: Containerfile removed external akmods FROM stages (ucore-hci bakes NVIDIA in)
- Fix: scripts/41-47 no longer duplicate dnf installs - PACKAGES.md is now the
       sole source of truth; 40-series scripts handle config+services only
- Added missing audited tools: strace, lsof, iotop, ntfs-3g, efibootmgr, nm-connection-editor

**CHANGELOG v0.2.0 (previous):**
- Added bootupd (unified bootloader updates -- Fedora 44 phase 1)
- Added dnf5-plugins (versionlock support for critical package pinning)
- Added systemd-boot-unsigned (UKI preparation -- future composefs+UKI chain)
- Added libsss_nss_idmap (fixes sssd-related dep resolution on F44)
- Added tpm2-tools (TPM2 support for measured boot / future attestation)
- Added clevis, clevis-luks (automated LUKS unlock via TPM2/Tang)
- Moved driverctl from security to utils (better categorization)

**CHANGELOG v0.2.0 (previous):**
- Removed htop (use btop instead)
- Added nvidia-settings to NVIDIA section
- Added avahi/nss-mdns for .local network discovery
- Added network-discovery package section

## Repositories

RPMFusion Free + Nonfree for NVIDIA drivers and multimedia codecs.
CrowdSec official repo with Fedora 40 fallback for Rawhide compatibility.

```packages-repos
rpmfusion-free-release-rawhide
rpmfusion-nonfree-release-rawhide
fedora-workstation-repositories
dnf-plugins-core
dnf5-plugins
```

## Base -- Security Stack (installed pre-pipeline)

Installed by Containerfile before automation/build.sh runs because every
later phase assumes SELinux tooling, audit, fapolicyd, crowdsec, and
usbguard are already present. Strict install: a missing package here is a
build failure, not a silent skip.

```packages-base
policycoreutils-python-utils
selinux-policy-targeted
firewalld
audit
fapolicyd
crowdsec
usbguard
# D-Bus: dbus-broker (CoreOS default) is the system bus on every
# deployment shape, including WSL. The WSL audit-subsystem-stripped
# kernel is handled by usr/lib/systemd/system/dbus-broker.service.d/
# 10-mios-no-audit.conf, which drops `--audit` from the broker's
# ExecStart. The legacy /usr/bin/dbus-daemon package is intentionally
# NOT installed -- shipping both broker and reference daemon would
# create a unit-file conflict (alias dbus.service -> two providers).
```

## Moby -- Docker-compatible engine

Installed by automation/21-moby-engine.sh.

```packages-moby
moby-engine
```

## UKI -- Unified Kernel Image tooling

Installed by automation/23-uki-render.sh.

```packages-uki
systemd-ukify
```

## SBOM -- Software Bill of Materials tooling

Installed by automation/90-generate-sbom.sh.

```packages-sbom-tools
syft
```

## K3s SELinux build dependencies

Installed by automation/19-k3s-selinux.sh to build the k3s SELinux module.

```packages-k3s-selinux-build
selinux-policy-devel
git
make
```

## Kernel

Kernel extras + development headers for akmod-nvidia and DKMS builds.
Base kernel ships with fedora-bootc:rawhide -- NEVER upgrade it in-container.
Upgrading triggers dracut under tmpfs which breaks the initramfs.

```packages-kernel
kernel-modules-extra

## GNOME 50 Desktop

MINIMAL GNOME shell -- infrastructure ONLY. **PROJECT INVARIANT:**
applications ship as Flatpaks (see `mios.toml` `[desktop].flatpaks`),
only system dependencies ship as RPMs. No exceptions.

GNOME 49+: systemd is a HARD dependency. gnome-session's built-in service
manager was removed. Full systemd user session support is required.
GNOME 50: X11 session removed upstream. Wayland-only (Fedora 43+ dropped X11).

## GNOME Flatpak Runtime -- portals + audio + theming for Flatpaks via WSLg

The MiOS podman backend (Windows-side) does not host its own
GNOME session -- WSLg is the Windows compositor and operators see
Flatpaks (Ptyxis terminal, Nautilus file manager, Software app store,
Epiphany browser, Flatseal permissions UI) as Windows windows routed
through the WSLg portal. Those Flatpaks ship their own GTK/libadwaita
via `org.gnome.Platform`, but they still need a **host portal +
audio router + Qt-Adwaita theming** so file dialogs, drag-and-drop,
audio output, and consistent theming all work. This section is the
**runtime-only** subset of `packages-gnome` -- the bits required for
Flatpaks to function on the dev VM, with **no display manager, no
gnome-shell, no GDM, no session services**.

Deployed bare-metal / Hyper-V / QEMU MiOS hosts install
`packages-gnome` (full session) instead.

## GNOME Core Apps -- DO NOT INSTALL AS RPM

**PROJECT INVARIANT:** GNOME Core apps are user-facing applications and
ship STRICTLY as Flatpaks. Add the Flathub ref to `mios.toml`
`[desktop].flatpaks` instead of uncommenting an RPM here.

| RPM (do not use) | Flathub ref |
|---|---|
| papers              | org.gnome.Papers |

## GPU Drivers -- Mesa (AMD / Intel / software fallback)

Universal Mesa stack supporting all AMD and Intel GPUs out of the box.
Mesa 26: ACO is now default shader compiler for RadeonSI.

```packages-gpu-mesa
mesa-vulkan-drivers
mesa-dri-drivers
mesa-va-drivers
vulkan-loader
vulkan-tools
libva-utils
linux-firmware
# microcode_ctl removed: redundant on F44+
```

## GPU Drivers -- AMD Compute (optional, fault-tolerant)

ROCm OpenCL/HIP for AMD compute workloads. This is one of the three GPU
compute paths (AMD / Intel / NVIDIA) that the CDI generators below expose to
containers -- the same hardware the local inference lanes claim for generation.

```packages-gpu-amd-compute
rocm-opencl
rocm-hip
rocm-runtime
rocm-smi
rocminfo
```

## GPU Drivers -- Intel Compute (oneAPI Level Zero)

Intel GPU compute runtime for OpenCL and Level Zero API.
Supports Intel Arc, Iris Xe, and integrated GPUs.
All packages are in official Fedora repos -- no extra repo needed.

```packages-gpu-intel-compute
intel-compute-runtime
intel-media-driver
# Intel oneAPI Level Zero loader. Ships in F44 via the
# intel-compute-runtime source RPM under the name intel-level-zero
# (the generic standalone "level-zero" loader is still in active
# Fedora packaging review -- track Phoronix/Fedora-IntelCompute2025).
intel-level-zero
# IGT (Intel GPU Tools): renamed from intel-gpu-tools to igt-gpu-tools
# in Fedora 44; provides intel_gpu_top, IGT test runner, and pmu-help
# for diagnostics. The "needs libproc2.so.0" issue cleared on F44.
igt-gpu-tools
```

## GPU Drivers -- NVIDIA (akmod, builds for any NVIDIA card)

NVIDIA proprietary drivers via RPMFusion akmod. Builds kmod at image time.
Driver 590+: Open kernel modules are DEFAULT for Turing (RTX 20+) and newer.
Blackwell (RTX 50): Open modules are the ONLY option -- proprietary incompatible.
WARNING: RTX 50-series has a VFIO reset bug -- see /usr/share/doc/mios-vfio-warning.txt
CDI is now the default mode in nvidia-container-toolkit v1.19+.

```packages-gpu-nvidia
akmod-nvidia
xorg-x11-drv-nvidia-cuda
nvidia-container-toolkit
nvidia-persistenced
nvidia-settings
xorg-x11-drv-nvidia-power
# v2.2 additions
nvidia-container-selinux
```

## GPU Container Device Interface toolkits (vendor CDI generators)

Out-of-Fedora binaries that emit `/run/cdi/*.{yaml,json}` so podman
containers can claim GPU access via `--device <vendor>.com/gpu=all`.
This CDI layer is the bridge between the GPU driver RPMs above and the
container plane: it is how the inference-lane Quadlets (`mios-llm-light` and
the gated heavy lanes) and the VFIO-passthrough VMs each get hardware.
NVIDIA's `nvidia-ctk` is part of `nvidia-container-toolkit` (above);
the AMD + Intel paths install via `automation/41-gpu-cdi-toolkits.sh`
because neither ships in Fedora repos as of May 2026:

* `amd-ctk` -- AMD Container Toolkit v1.3+ (RHEL9 RPM works on F44).
  Source: github.com/ROCm/container-toolkit. Generates
  `/run/cdi/amd.json` for any host with `/dev/kfd`. CDI key:
  `amd.com/gpu=all`.

* `intel-cdi-specs-generator` -- intel/intel-resource-drivers-for-
  kubernetes static binary. Best-effort (v0.x upstream). Installed
  to `/usr/libexec/mios/intel-cdi-specs-generator`. Generates
  `/run/cdi/intel.yaml` for hosts with an Intel render node
  (vendor:0x8086 on /dev/dri/renderD*). CDI key: `intel.com/gpu=all`.

Both are consumed by `/usr/libexec/mios/mios-cdi-detect` at boot
(via `mios-cdi-detect.service`). Missing toolkits make the
corresponding branch a no-op rather than failing the boot.

```packages-gpu-cdi-toolkits
# Intentionally empty -- amd-ctk + intel-cdi-specs-generator are
# fetched by automation/41-gpu-cdi-toolkits.sh from upstream
# GitHub releases (same pattern as 37-aichat.sh / 38-oh-my-posh.sh).
# Versions tracked via record_version (build metadata).
```

## Virtualization -- KVM / QEMU / Libvirt

System-level KVM stack: hypervisor, libvirt daemon, firmware, CLI helpers.
This is the substrate for the **VM** delivery channel and for VFIO-PCI GPU
passthrough (hand a discrete GPU to a Windows guest and game on it).
GUI front-ends ship as Flatpaks per project invariant -- see `mios.toml`
`[desktop].flatpaks` (`org.virt_manager.Manager`,
`org.remmina.Remmina` for VNC/SPICE/RDP viewer needs).

```packages-virt
qemu-kvm
libvirt
libvirt-daemon
virt-install
edk2-ovmf
swtpm
swtpm-tools
dnsmasq
mdevctl
libguestfs-tools
# v2.2 additions
virt-v2v
qemu-device-display-virtio-gpu
virt-firmware
python3-cryptography
# ── Application RPMs removed per project invariant ──
# virt-manager  -> Flathub: org.virt_manager.Manager
# virt-viewer   -> Flathub: org.remmina.Remmina (covers SPICE/VNC/RDP)
```

## Container Runtime

Podman, Buildah, Skopeo, bootc tooling, and OCI image building. This is the
substrate for the **Container** delivery channel -- the engine that runs every
agent/service Quadlet (the AI lanes, `mios-pgvector`, `mios-open-webui`,
`mios-searxng`, Forgejo, Ceph, k3s) -- and the toolchain that builds and
upgrades the MiOS image itself via `bootc`.

```packages-containers

# Build toolchain moved to `packages-build-toolchain` (image-build only;
# stripped by automation/91-strip-build-toolchain.sh before image commit
# so the deployed runtime carries no compilers).
# REMOVED -- podman-docker: conflicts with moby-engine from ucore-hci base
```

## Build Toolchain (image-build time ONLY)

These compilers and devel headers are required by image-build phases
(`19-k3s-selinux.sh` builds the k3s SELinux policy module,
`53-bake-lookingglass-client.sh` compiles Looking Glass B7 from source)
but **do not belong on the runtime image** -- a deployed host carrying
gcc/cmake/golang is unnecessary attack surface for any process that
gets a shell.

`automation/12-virt.sh` installs this block early, the build phases
that need it consume it, and `automation/91-strip-build-toolchain.sh`
removes it after `90-generate-sbom.sh` records the versions and before
`99-cleanup.sh` runs. The block is also in the FHS-install exclude
list (`mios-bootstrap/build-mios.sh`) so a deployed FHS host never
installs it in the first place.

```packages-build-toolchain
make
gcc
gcc-c++
cmake
golang
selinux-policy-devel
binutils
pkgconf-pkg-config
```

## Self-Building Tools (Experimental/Repository dependent)

Tools needed for the image to rebuild itself -- part of what makes MiOS
"self-replicating": a booted host can build the next image of itself.
May fail if specialized repos are not enabled.

```packages-self-build
bootc-base-imagectl
konflux-image-tools
```

## Boot & Update Management

Bootloader updates and system update tooling for bootc systems.
bootupd: unified bootloader update service (Fedora 44 phase 1).
dnf5-plugins: versionlock for pinning critical packages (Mesa, PipeWire, etc.)

```packages-boot
bootupd
dnf5-plugins
systemd-boot-unsigned
efibootmgr
systemd-ukify
binutils
efitools
sbsigntools
tpm2-tss
```

## Cockpit Web Management

Full Cockpit ecosystem -- file browser, virt, podman, storage, network,
SELinux, ostree, kdump, sosreport -- plus the Performance Co-Pilot
(PCP) stack that powers the Metrics page.

`cockpit-packagekit` is intentionally **excluded**: PackageKit is in
`packages-bloat` because bootc + Flatpak handle every update path on
MiOS, so the Cockpit "Software Updates" tab has nothing to drive.

`pcp-zeroconf` is the load-bearing fix for the "Metrics history could
not be loaded -- pmlogger.service is not running" error: stock `pcp`
ships pmlogger.service / pmproxy.service with `disabled` preset, and
`pcp-zeroconf` is the package whose `%post` flips the preset and
writes the default archive-collection config under
`/etc/pcp/pmlogger/control.d/`. Without zeroconf the Cockpit Metrics
page renders an empty error state on first boot.

`cockpit-pcp` is restored (was removed in v0.2.0 with the rationale
"now native in cockpit-bridge since Cockpit 326" -- accurate for the
LIVE metrics view, but the historical-archive renderer in the Metrics
tab still consults the cockpit-pcp bridge for `/var/log/pcp/pmlogger/`
archives).

PMDAs added so the Metrics tab has interesting series to plot:

* `pcp-pmda-systemd` -- per-service CPU / mem / I/O metrics, indexed
  by unit name. Required for the "by service" Metrics drill-down.
* `pcp-pmda-openmetrics` -- scrapes any Prometheus `/metrics` endpoint
  on the host into PCP, so node_exporter / cadvisor / etc. show up
  in the same Cockpit Metrics graphs as native PCP metrics.

```packages-wintools
hyperv-tools
samba
samba-client
cifs-utils
# freerdp-libs stays as a system library (gnome-remote-desktop and other
# host services link against it). The freerdp CLI client itself was an
# application -- removed per project invariant; use org.remmina.Remmina
# (already in mios.toml [desktop].flatpaks) for RDP/SPICE/VNC.
freerdp-libs
```

## Security

Host-based IPS, application whitelisting, USB device control. This is the
substrate behind Architectural Law 6 (unprivileged Quadlets): SELinux,
fapolicyd deny-by-default, USBGuard, and CrowdSec are what keep the agent
plane sandboxed and least-privileged.
CRITICAL: nvidia-container-toolkit >= v1.17.8 required (CVE-2025-23266/23267).

## Gaming

Gaming clients and Wine ship STRICTLY as Flatpaks per project invariant.
This section retains only the system-level pieces that Flatpak gaming
clients depend on (gamemode daemon, vulkan tooling, controller udev
rules, the gamemode shell extension).

NTSYNC kernel module available in Fedora 44 for improved Wine/Steam
performance via the Steam Flatpak's bundled Proton.

```packages-gaming
# ── System daemons / shell extension / udev (NOT apps) ──
gamemode
gnome-shell-extension-gamemode
vulkan-tools
steam-devices
# ── Application RPMs removed per project invariant ──
# steam            -> Flathub: com.valvesoftware.Steam (bundles Proton)
# lutris           -> Flathub: net.lutris.Lutris
# dosbox-staging   -> Flathub: io.github.dosbox_staging.dosbox-staging
# protontricks     -> Flathub: com.github.Matoking.protontricks
# mangohud         -> Flathub extension: org.freedesktop.Platform.VulkanLayer.MangoHud
# gamescope        -> shipped inside Steam Flatpak; install separately only if
#                     a non-Steam Wayland gaming session is required (then via
#                     Flathub: org.gamescope.Session if/when published)
# wine, wine-mono, wine-dxvk, winetricks
#                  -> non-Steam Windows apps: Flathub com.usebottles.bottles
#                     (bundles its own Wine/DXVK/winetricks)

## Android -- Waydroid

Waydroid container runtime for Android apps.
Note: NVIDIA GPUs lack full 3D acceleration in Waydroid (Mesa/AMD/Intel only).

```packages-android

```

## Looking Glass B7 -- Build Dependencies

These packages are installed during the build to compile Looking Glass B7.
They are REMOVED after compilation to keep the image small. Looking Glass is
the low-latency frame relay that pairs with VFIO GPU passthrough so the host
sees a passthrough VM's display without a second monitor.

## Network Discovery -- Avahi / mDNS

mDNS/DNS-SD for automatic .local hostname discovery on LAN.
Every 'MiOS' instance advertises Cockpit and RDP services.

## Updater -- uupd / Greenboot (v2.2)

uupd is the Universal Blue unified updater. It replaces `bootc-fetch-apply-updates.timer`,
flatpak update timer, and distrobox update timer with a single Go binary that
handles all three. Ships via ublue-os/packages COPR (enabled in 05-enable-external-repos.sh).

Greenboot provides health-check driven auto-rollback: 3 failed boots triggers
`bootc rollback` via grub boot_counter. Health checks live in /etc/greenboot/check/{required,wanted}.d/.
These two are the substrate for the `git pull` / `Ctrl-Z` lifecycle that
defines MiOS as an image: uupd is the `git pull`, greenboot is the safety net.

```packages-updater
uupd
greenboot
greenboot-default-health-checks

## AI Tools
Client-side SDK + AI assistant CLIs for the local OpenAI-compatible brain.

This section is the **client** half of the AI plane: the SDK and editor/CLI
agents that *talk to* the local inference lanes. The inference engines and the
agent orchestration themselves are **not** RPMs -- they ship as Quadlet
containers (the **Container** delivery channel): the primary lane is
`mios-llm-light` (the `llama.cpp` multi-model server fronted by the upstream
`llama-swap` proxy image) on **:11450**, which also serves embeddings
(`nomic-embed-text`, OpenAI-compatible `/v1/embeddings`) and the `mios-opencode`
coder model; the gated heavy lanes are `mios-llm-heavy` (SGLang, :11441) and
`mios-llm-heavy-alt` (vLLM). The unified agent datastore is **PostgreSQL +
pgvector** (`mios-pgvector`, :5432). Every agent and tool resolves the one
endpoint from `MIOS_AI_ENDPOINT` (Architectural Law 5) rather than hard-coding a
port or vendor URL.

The packages here are deliberately thin:

* `python3-openai` -- the official OpenAI Python SDK, used by `/usr/bin/mios` to
  drive the local OpenAI-API-compatible endpoint at `MIOS_AI_ENDPOINT`. The SDK
  provides the streaming + tool-call roundtrip + structured-outputs surface that
  maps onto Architectural Law 5. F44+ ships the SDK in repos as `python3-openai`;
  it is installed via dnf rather than pip so it is captured by the image SBOM.
* `nodejs` / `npm` -- the JS runtime required by the npm-installed AI assistant
  CLIs below.
* `nano` -- baseline text editor for operator config edits.

AI assistant CLIs install globally via npm (`npm_globals` in `mios.toml`
`[packages.ai]`) by `/usr/libexec/mios/install-ai-clis.sh` during the overlay
phase; the current set is `@anthropic-ai/claude-code` and `@google/gemini-cli`.
These are OpenAI-API-compatible clients that, like every other agent, target
`MIOS_AI_ENDPOINT` and thus the same local brain -- no vendor account in the loop.

```packages-ai
python3-openai
nodejs
npm
nano
```

> **Historical note (migration complete).** Earlier MiOS revisions ran inference
> and embeddings on an **Ollama** container (the `mios-ollama` / `mios-ollama-cpu`
> units, model-bake `37-ollama-prep`, Modelfiles, and the legacy `aichat` /
> `aichat-ng` musl-binary CLIs fetched by `37-aichat.sh`). That stack has been
> fully removed: inference + embeddings now run on `mios-llm-light` (:11450), and
> the agent datastore moved from SurrealDB/Qdrant to PostgreSQL+pgvector. Ollama
> survives only as an **upstream API-compat reference** -- the lanes speak the
> OpenAI/Ollama-compatible API so any such client connects unchanged -- not as a
> live MiOS backend.

## Internal -- Critical Validation

These packages MUST be present in the final image. Build scripts use this
section for post-build verification.

gdm
podman
bootc
libvirt
kernel-core
firewalld
cockpit
NetworkManager
pipewire
tuned
chrony
openssh-server
```

## Internal -- Bloat Removal

These packages are explicitly removed during the build to keep the image
lean and free of unwanted UI components.

```packages-bloat
malcontent-control
malcontent-pam
malcontent-tools
gnome-tour
gnome-initial-setup
PackageKit
PackageKit-command-not-found
```

## Network UPS Tools (NUT)
