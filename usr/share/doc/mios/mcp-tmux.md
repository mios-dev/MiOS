# Native MiOS terminal and MCP

The native MiOS-MCP server publishes the existing MiOS verbs, promoted skills,
recipes and read-only resources, alongside `mios_tmux_*` terminal tools. Existing
dispatch and resource handlers remain intact. The same stdio server is registered
with the agent-pipe consumer in terminal-only mode, preventing recursive MiOS
catalog discovery. Local coordinating clients use the full combined endpoint.

`[packages.mcp]` is mandatory in the workstation, dev environment and shared
`mios-base` service image. Every MiOS-owned final service image inherits this
base. Upstream build stages and third-party OCI dependencies keep their original
bases. The SDK installs offline from the declared wheelhouse; architecture-specific
tmux-mcp archives and patched font assets are checked against SSOT SHA-256 values
before installation. A source change does not deploy already published images:
the native image pipeline must build and publish the new revision.

## Process boundaries and completion

MadAppGang's slot-based tools run behind the SDK's protocol negotiation and
framing. The adapter publishes the SSOT allowlist with bounded slots and timeouts.
It does not invent raw `split-pane` tools that this upstream does not expose.
Each stdio connection owns a private `0700` runtime directory, HOME and tmux
socket hierarchy. Automation uses `mcp-headless`; human sessions use the separate
SSOT `mios-human` socket. Personal shell startup hooks and ambient API keys are
excluded from worker environments.

HTTP clients must call `mios_tmux_session_open`, keep its opaque capability
private, and supply `session` on terminal calls. This is explicit because modern
stateless MCP HTTP requests share the application's lifespan. Capabilities expire
after the SSOT idle interval and are reclaimed on shutdown. Session count, busy
slots, cancellation, closed capabilities and command timeouts fail explicitly.
The loopback service is intended for trusted local clients. Its capability is
session separation, not a security boundary against another process with the same
UID. Arbitrary shell tools retain the caller's filesystem permissions.

Batch execution requires an upstream exit receipt. Nonzero status, missing
receipts and timeouts report MCP errors; timed-out/cancelled panes are retired.
Wait-channel inspection indicates interactive input readiness and cannot prove
that an agent's turn is complete. Generator/verifier lanes still need independent
worktrees, explicit completion receipts and the existing two-sided verification
ladder. Avoid installing blanket approval bypasses as system defaults.

Terminal screen capture is a display transcript, not a byte-exact artifact log.
Verification commands must write original output to files and compute hashes and
byte counts from those files. Keep positive and planted-negative logs separately;
revert mutations and audit the pre-mutation snapshot, including untracked files.
Resolve Git metadata with `git rev-parse --git-path` or `--git-dir`, and retain the
existing shared-ref locking/backoff adapter.

## Addressed agent sessions

`[mcp.agents]` configures the native `mios-agent-relay` transaction engine.
The combined endpoint adds six `mios_agent_*` tools without removing the legacy
catalog. Each participating running CLI or chat registers a session ID and keeps
its returned lease private. Registered sessions share a caller-owned state
directory; nested tmux workers inherit only the directory pointer, not leases.

Use `mios_agent_list` for live session discovery, `mios_agent_send` for addressed
tasks or replies, `mios_agent_receive` to read the recipient's inbox, and
`mios_agent_ack` after reading. Reusing a message ID makes retries idempotent and
returns its current receipt. A queued message is not delivery, and a received
receipt is not completion. `mios_agent_unregister` marks a session offline.
Leases expire; queue, message, session and retained receipt limits come from SSOT.

A local live CLI test used an Antigravity head in an MCP tmux pane to launch
another Antigravity CLI, send it a task, and receive its reply through these
mailboxes. The worker queried the seven installed SSOT CLIs and observed
`codex-cli 0.160.0` in a nested pane. Both task and reply acquired recipient
acknowledgments. This tests the local Linux CLI path; it does not certify every
harness, a published image generation, or an existing desktop conversation.
Headless clients need an explicit permission policy for the tools their task
requires. An exit-zero CLI result with `denied_actions` is a failed task, even
when its wrapper labels the result `SUCCESS`.

On 4 October 2026, a separate live test connected with Windows OpenSSH and a
PTY to the localhost Windows CMD shell, confirmed all seven globally installed
agent commands on the host PATH, and typed `mios`. It attached to native MiOS
tmux with the SSOT truecolor status bar and Oh My Posh prompt. An Antigravity
head launched a worker through the combined MCP tmux tools; that worker ran
`mios agents` and `mios agent codex --version` in another pane. The head then
sent the result to this running Codex chat, and Codex replied through MiOS-MCP.
The task, worker reply, head-to-Codex result and Codex-to-head reply all had
recipient acknowledgment receipts of `received`. The observed worker result
was `MIOS_NESTED_WORKER_OK; installed=7; codex=codex-cli 0.160.0`.

The initial worker permission denial required a scoped tool policy correction;
the head also needed a conversation resume after its reply wait expired. The
completed runs had no denied actions. The temporary SSH authorization and
permission policy were removed afterward. This proves the tested Windows SSH,
Linux CLI and current Codex chat path. It does not establish automatic delivery
to an unregistered desktop conversation or authenticated inference for every
installed provider CLI.

Both participants must actually consume the MCP tools. This mailbox does not
inject a user turn into an unrelated desktop chat, register an installed binary
as a running session, or convert an A2A model-service card into a CLI address.
Peer messages remain context inside the human-authorized task. They do not
grant new permission or override the receiving agent's instructions.

## Translation layer and nested workflows

The combined endpoint exposes the native translation layer alongside terminal
and agent relay surfaces:

1. `translate_frames` normalizes frames across dialects (AGY stream JSON, Claude
   print-mode JSON, OpenAI Responses/Codex items, and OpenAI-compatible Chat
   Completions) to ordered `loop.v1` events and Responses items. Source `auto`
   sniffs the frame shape. Credential fields are refused by name before processing;
   terminal `delivered` events require gate evidence and demote to `unverified`
   or `vacuous` otherwise.
2. `mios_tmux_nested_workflow` automates launching nested tasks across any of the
   seven installed global agent CLIs (`claude`, `codex`, `gemini`, `copilot`,
   `opencode`, `agy`, `aider`) inside isolated tmux slots (1..32). It sets up
   private environments with the shared relay pointer, executes the task, strips
   terminal ANSI escapes, extracts receipts, and translates output frames.
3. Concurrent slots remain fully isolated with independent per-slot locks,
   enabling parallel multi-agent trees and swarms without dirty buffer contention.

## Theme projection at build and runtime

The vendor TOML, `/etc/mios` overrides and caller's `~/.config/mios` overrides
form the theme contract. Build-time generators emit shipped terminal, tmux,
compositor, prompt and keybinding files. Native `mios-terminal`, MCP pane startup
and interactive login startup re-render the prompt and tmux configuration into a
caller-owned runtime directory. `/usr` remains immutable during runtime.

Windows startup invokes the native WSL resolver through the installed dispatcher.
It atomically projects the palette, font and settings for Windows Terminal and
the Oh My Posh prompt from the same layered TOML. The launcher reads current
dimensions and profile names from that projection. The native Windows launcher
uses per-monitor DPI awareness, measures visible window bounds, fits oversized
windows to the current work area and centers the window containing its new MiOS
tab. The launch verification uses a separate window to preserve existing tabs.
Synthetic tests cover negative monitor origins, portrait layouts, large scaling
factors and oversized windows; physical display verification remains specific
to hardware tested.

Use `mios terminal`, `mios terminal --action ai`, `mios mcp` or, on Windows CMD,
`mios ssh [OpenSSH options] user@host`. Windows installation preserves existing
verb dispatch, unrelated MCP client configuration and editor settings, with
backups when owned files change. See [mobile shortcuts](guides/mobile-keybindings.md).

## Licensing and validation

MiOS's repository license is Apache-2.0. Upstream tmux-mcp's README declares MIT;
the release lacks a separate root license file. The vendored README and verbatim
Go dependency notices are retained under `/usr/share/licenses/tmux-mcp`.
Font licenses remain with the installed archive. Do not infer blanket copyleft
obligations merely from IPC or claim legal approval from an architecture diagram.

`test_mios_mcp_aio.py` exercises real upstream tmux processes, stdio/HTTP protocol
eras, persistent private HOME state, concurrent slots, exit receipts, cancellation,
timeouts, policy rejection, resource/dispatch parity and corrupt-archive rejection.
The `--negative-receipt` mode must exit 23 with `DEVLOOP-PLANTED-EXIT`.
Rust keybinding tests plant duplicates and committed-file drift; theme gates
reject invalid projections and compare shipped files with SSOT output.
