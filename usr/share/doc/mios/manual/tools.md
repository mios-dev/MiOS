Strip INHERITED MIOS_* before running the bash twin. The comparison asks
"what does userenv.sh resolve from SSOT?", but bash reports every MIOS_*
in its environment -- so any ambient var the TOML side has no key for
shows up as a mismatch. CI sets MIOS_DRIFT_REQUIRE_TOOLS=1 as a workflow
knob, which failed the check with:
  Var MIOS_DRIFT_REQUIRE_TOOLS: Toml resolved '', Bash resolved '1'
Keep only the tier pointers the resolver needs to find the SSOT layers.

Repo-relative paths git tracks, or None when git is unavailable.

    The manifests embed a walk of the tree. Walking the FILESYSTEM makes the
    output a function of the developer's working directory -- local scratch
    files, .bak files and untracked notes all land in root-manifest.json -- so
    a manifest generated on a dev box can never match one regenerated on a
    clean CI checkout, and check_ai_manifests_fresh fails forever. Restricting
    the walk to tracked files makes the artifact reproducible anywhere.

### Generate the MiOS agent egress firewall (#54). Zero-trust...

Generate the MiOS agent egress firewall (#54).

Zero-trust federation calls for an OUTBOUND firewall: a compromised or misled
agent must not be able to exfiltrate to arbitrary internet hosts. The correct
layer for that is the OS (nftables), scoped to the agent's uid -- an app-level
hook would be incomplete (httpx clients are constructed ad-hoc throughout the
orchestrator). This emits that ruleset from SSOT; the operator applies it.

It is uid-scoped, so it does not disturb other users: `web_search` keeps working
because the agent reaches searxng over loopback, and searxng (a different uid)
reaches the internet.

### This used to rmtree repo_root/usr/share/doc/mios/manual...

This used to rmtree repo_root/usr/share/doc/mios/manual unconditionally,
derived from repo_root and ignoring --output entirely: pointing --output at
a scratch file still deleted the in-repo directory. That directory is where
AUTHORED manual prose is meant to live, so the tool could destroy
hand-written content that no generator can reproduce. Clean only a stale
split-page directory that sits beside the file we are actually writing, and
never one holding git-tracked files.

### Generate MiOS .pod Quadlets from the [pods.*] SSOT (WS-7)....

Generate MiOS .pod Quadlets from the [pods.*] SSOT (WS-7).

A co-resident group -- a set of containers that must share a podman pod (one
network namespace + lifecycle) -- was previously a hand-authored .pod Quadlet
(only mios-webtools). That is drift-prone: the pod's [Unit]/[Pod]/[Install] and
its member list lived only in the file. This projects each [pods.<name>] in
mios.toml to a deterministic <name>.pod under usr/share/containers/systemd/, so:

  * the co-resident group is declared ONCE (SSOT), and
  * tools/generate-k3s-manifests.sh -- which reads the LIVE pods -- projects the
    same workloads to k3s, so the cluster path is one faithful bridge from SSOT.

Each member .container still declares `Pod=<name>.pod` (Quadlet wires the
Wants/After on the pod service); the member list here is the documented SSOT +
fuels a drift check that every declared member exists as a .container.

Pure renderer (render_pod_quadlet) so it unit-tests offline (--selftest), in the
sibling style of the other tools/ generators. Same SSOT -> byte-identical output.

<!-- mios-src:11f8e1c5b95e from tools/generate-pod-quadlets.py:5-23 -->

[image.sidecars] -- the digest-pinned image SSOT. Consulted by
    _sidecar_image() so bare (no-userenv) regeneration renders the committed
    @sha256 instead of the digestless inline fallback (Quadlet digest drift).

### Provision the MiOS agent mTLS keypair + CA (#54)....

Provision the MiOS agent mTLS keypair + CA (#54).

Zero-trust federation needs peers to mutually authenticate. The ed25519 *message*
principal (#60) signs delegations; mTLS authenticates the *transport*. This mints
the PKI for that: a self-signed local CA + an agent leaf certificate (clientAuth +
serverAuth) signed by it. Peers trust each other by exchanging CA certs.

Trust model: self-signed local CA per node is the standard self-hosted default
(point [security.mtls] at an existing org CA to override). The enforcing half --
making the A2A endpoint REQUIRE client certs -- is reverse-proxy deployment
(MiOS terminates TLS at the proxy), documented in security/README.md; this tool
only provisions the credentials.

Idempotent: an existing CA is reused (so peer trust survives re-runs); the agent
leaf is re-issued. Requires `cryptography`. Run where the certs should live.

### render-globals.py -- generate BOTH globals resolvers from...

render-globals.py -- generate BOTH globals resolvers from the SSOT.

automation/lib/globals.sh and globals.ps1 used to be two divergent hand-typed
registries (~200 literals each) kept in step with mios.toml only by drift
checks. They are now generated in full, directly, under their original names --
every consumer that sources/dot-sources them is untouched, and there is no
`.generated` sidecar and no shim layer.

Only ONE thing cannot be a constant: the version, which is read from a file at
run time. That logic is emitted as a preamble from this generator, so it still
lives in exactly one place.

Usage:
    tools/render-globals.py           # write both resolvers
    tools/render-globals.py --check   # exit 1 if either has drifted

<!-- mios-src:a14177eaae8b from tools/render-globals.py:5-20 -->

Assign-if-unset.

    Prefer the idiomatic `: "${VAR:=value}"` -- several drift checks parse that
    exact shape out of this file. It is unusable when the value contains `}`
    (message templates carry `{placeholder}`), which would close the expansion
    early and make the file a syntax error; those fall back to
    `[ -n "${VAR+x}" ] ||`, which has identical already-set-wins semantics.

The word in `"${VAR:=word}"` is still quote-processed, so a lone ' or "
inside it (e.g. "the operator's phone") starts an unterminated quote.
Only take the idiomatic form when the value is free of every metacharacter.

<!-- mios-src:ea6d3604444b from tools/render-globals.py:243-245 -->

### render-ports.py -- project [ports.categories] onto the flat...

render-ports.py -- project [ports.categories] onto the flat [ports] table.

The categories table is the numbering SSOT: each category owns a `base`, a
`stride` and an ORDERED `members` list, and a member's port is

    base + index_in_members * stride

`pinned` entries (DNS/53) are protocol contracts and are emitted verbatim.

Usage:
    tools/render-ports.py            # rewrite the flat [ports] table in place
    tools/render-ports.py --check    # exit 1 if the flat table has drifted
    tools/render-ports.py --print    # print the derived name=port map

<!-- mios-src:11affdf550ad from tools/render-ports.py:5-18 -->

### Return {port_name: value} derived from [ports.categories]....

Return {port_name: value} derived from [ports.categories].

    Pinned ports are emitted at their literal value; derived ports are
    base + index*stride. stack_id is applied later by the resolver's
    process_val(), not here, so this stays the pre-offset SSOT.

`${MIOS_PORT_X:-1234}` literals are degrade-open defaults, but a
    hand-typed one silently goes stale the moment a category base moves. Treat
    them as GENERATED: rewrite every one to its SSOT value.

<!-- mios-src:8d84ef72541b from tools/render-ports.py:192-194 -->

### Resolve the python MiOS itself provisions. Python is a...

Resolve the python MiOS itself provisions.

Python is a DECLARED MiOS dependency, not something to hope for: mios.toml
[apps.winget].pkgs lists "Python.Python.3.14" under "Critical runtime /
toolchain", so every MiOS host has it globally (dnf python3 on Linux, winget
on Windows), and installation/mios-install.ps1 + Reinstall-MiOSDEV.ps1 already
resolve it at %LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\Python\Python314\python.exe.

The trap: `command -v python` SUCCEEDS on Windows even when it resolves to the
Microsoft Store alias stub, which prints "Python was not found" and exits. The
old probe (`command -v python3 || PY=python`) therefore set PY to the stub, and
every generator below silently did nothing while sync reported success -- the
tree looked synced while the manifests went stale. So probe by EXECUTING, and
try the MiOS-installed interpreter before bare names.

<!-- mios-src:4cf964f45b77 from tools/sync-generated.sh:24-37 -->

### EVERY renderer resolves through the layered resolver, which...

EVERY renderer resolves through the layered resolver, which honours
MIOS_ROOT / MIOS_TOML* from the environment. On a MiOS host (or the MiOS-DEV
container) those are already exported and point at the INSTALLED system, so
an unpinned run silently renders the installed SSOT into this repo's
artefacts -- which is how globals.ps1 ended up carrying 'MiOS User' and
the installed host's `agent_pipe` port. Pin every tier to the tree being synced.

### title

title: MiOS Computer Use
author: MiOS
version: 0.1.0
description: |
  ONE Open WebUI Native tool surfacing the MiOS computer-use capability
  (WS-4 P0) as typed tool_calls: the EXISTING desktop control + vision
  grounding verbs (mios-computer-use / mios-pc-control / mios-pc-vision)
  PLUS the new FOSS offline document generation tool (mios-docgen ->
  Pandoc + LibreOffice). The chat model invokes these directly instead of
  indirecting through the generic `terminal:` shell tool.

  This is the LiteCUA Perceptor/Reasoner/Worker pattern assembled from
  MiOS parts (NO Wide-Moat / BSL vendor stack -- see
  concepts/aios-implementation-plan.md section 0-B):
    * Perceive : cu_screenshot  (one-shot capture)
    * Ground   : cu_ground / cu_atspi_query  (AT-SPI first, vision fallback)
    * Act      : cu_click / cu_type / cu_key / cu_key_combo / cu_window_list
    * Produce  : docgen_build / docgen_convert  (author/convert artifacts)

  Dispatch goes through the OPERATOR-side launcher broker (unix socket at
  /run/mios-launcher/launcher.sock), exactly like the sibling mios_verbs
  tool -- so the verbs inherit the operator's WSLg / Wayland session
  (WAYLAND_DISPLAY, DBUS, WSL_INTEROP) that an in-container subprocess
  could never see.

  GATING + SAFETY (binding rule -- default-off / degrade-open):
    * Master valve ENABLED (default True) toggles the whole tool.
    * WRITE_ACTIONS_ENABLED (default FALSE) gates the side-effecting input
      verbs (click/type/key/key_combo). Read-class verbs (screenshot,
      ground, atspi_query, window_list, docgen) work with writes off.
    * mios-docgen itself is independently gated by [computer_use].docgen_enable
      server-side; when off it returns ok=false (this tool surfaces that).
  Every method returns structured JSON the model can reason over, so a
  failure is unambiguous (no "I clicked the button" hallucination over a
  silently-failed call).

Capture the desktop to a PNG (one-shot, read-only). Env-adaptive:
        local Wayland (portal/grim), WSLg via mios-pc-control, or a federated
        remote executor -- the same verb works everywhere.

        :param path: Output PNG path (e.g. /tmp/screen.png). Feed this to
            cu_ground to locate a UI element before clicking.

Locate a UI element by natural-language description -> click
        coordinates. Read-only. AT-SPI accessibility tree FIRST (deterministic,
        no pixels), local vision model (qwen3-vl / UI-TARS) only as fallback.
        Returns {x, y, confidence}; pass x/y to cu_click.

        :param query: Description of the target (e.g. "the OK button",
            "the search field", "Save toolbar icon").
        :return: JSON {x, y, confidence, reasoning, source}.

Semantic accessibility-tree lookup (role/name match) -> screen
        coordinates, NO pixels/vision. Read-only. Faster + more reliable than
        cu_ground for standard widgets (buttons, menus, fields).

Click at pixel (x,y) on the desktop. WRITE action -- gated.
        Usually preceded by cu_ground / cu_atspi_query to find the coords.

        :param x: X pixel offset from top-left.
        :param y: Y pixel offset from top-left.
        :param button: left (default) | right | middle.

Type literal text into the focused surface. WRITE action -- gated.
        For editing FILES prefer the text-editor verbs; this is for live UI.

Author a NEW document from text content you write, emitting a real
        office artifact (.docx / .pptx / .xlsx / .pdf / .html). The OUTPUT
        FORMAT is inferred from out_path's extension. You write markdown (or
        CSV for spreadsheets); MiOS renders the binary via Pandoc / LibreOffice
        -- fully local, no cloud. For .pptx, separate slides with a line of
        `---`. For .xlsx, set from_fmt="csv" and put CSV rows in content.

        :param out_path: Destination path with the target extension
            (e.g. /tmp/report.docx, /tmp/deck.pptx, /tmp/data.xlsx, /tmp/x.pdf).
        :param content: The source content to render. Markdown for docx/pptx/
            pdf/html; raw CSV rows for xlsx (with from_fmt="csv").
        :param from_fmt: Source format of `content`: markdown (default) |
            plain | html | csv.
        :return: JSON {ok, output, source, target, bytes} or {ok:false, error}.

Convert an EXISTING file to another format (e.g. .docx -> .pdf,

        LibreOffice headless. Target format inferred from out_path's extension.

        :param in_path: Source file path (must exist on the host).
        :param out_path: Destination path; its extension picks the format.
        :return: JSON {ok, input, output, source, target, bytes} or

### A ratchet ceiling, or a hard failure if the SSOT has...

A ratchet ceiling, or a hard failure if the SSOT has stopped carrying it.

        Defaulting an absent ceiling to 999999 makes the check unfailable the
        moment a key is renamed, and it keeps reporting PASS while doing so --
        the worst outcome, because it also stops anyone looking. An absent
        ceiling is a broken gate, not an unlimited one.

<!-- mios-src:6052f6ace2c5 from tools/check-comment-ratchet.py:31-37 -->

### Gate

Gate: a hazard that only bites above one node is counted, not discovered.

A MiOS-Metal fleet is 2-6 boxes, so a config that only works standalone is a
defect waiting for the operator to add a peer. Each hazard is detected from the
tree rather than from a hand-list -- multiple archetypes able to stand up a k3s
control plane with no join path, and Pacemaker with fencing disabled -- and
every one must sit in the shrink-only [blades.hazards].accepted register under a
max_accepted ratchet. A NEW hazard fails; an entry that no longer reproduces
fails too, so the register cannot be padded.

Tests for the above-one-node hazard gate.

Both detectors are covered independently: k3s multi-server needs BOTH two
grantors and a join-less `k3s server`, so a K3S_URL or a single grantor must
clear it, and pacemaker fencing must be read from code and not from comments.
Then every way the register stops measuring -- unsorted, duplicated, an unknown
id that can never retire, an entry that no longer reproduces, a missing ceiling,
a raised ceiling, a ceiling left high. Declaring max_nodes = 1 disarms the
hazards, because standalone is a real deployment and not a loophole.

The three behaviours the drift gate depends on.

An empty launcher table used to render nothing, compare nothing, and report
success while 9 launchers shipped ungoverned -- so "refuses an empty table" is
the fixture that matters most here.

What the mirror must not get wrong.

Two failure modes are specific and expensive: silently WRITING when only asked
to report, and appending a duplicate table instead of rewriting one -- the
duplicate-table bug that has made mios.toml unparseable twice in this repo.

### One reader for the suite registry, so listing and checking...

One reader for the suite registry, so listing and checking cannot disagree.

Both publishers ask this module what to run. Before it existed each workflow
carried its own hand-written list: GitHub ran fifteen suites, Forgejo ran eight,
and thirteen tracked suites ran nowhere at all -- including nine that failed
only because they pointed at the INSTALLED agent-pipe rather than the tree they
ship from. Nobody noticed, because a suite nobody runs reports nothing.

--check is what keeps that from recurring: a tracked suite must be in a tier, be
matched by a glob entry, or be exempt with a reason. Adding a test file and no
registration turns the gate red.

Publisher parity. Registering a tier nobody invokes is the same as not

A file both repos track must be mirrored or explicitly not mirrored.

    Thirty-five files were tracked in both repositories; sixteen were declared
    and eighteen of the remaining nineteen had already diverged, silently,
    because nothing required them to be classified at all.

### A negative test mutates the tree and is supposed to put it...

A negative test mutates the tree and is supposed to put it back.

When one does not, the mutation ships. Three reached the SSOT in a single
session: a capability requirement replaced with an injected name, a port list
with an entry repeated twice, and a threshold key commented out. Between them
they turned five suites red, and the failures pointed at the suites rather than
at the leak, so the cost was paid several times over before anyone looked at the
SSOT diff.

Backup files count too. Copies with a rescue suffix are how a test preserves
the original, and a run that dies before restoring leaves one in the tree.

This scans what git tracks, because an untracked leftover is a local mess while
a tracked one is shipped.

Native man pages, rendered like every other projection.

They are ordinary roff files under usr/share/man, so man, apropos and man -k
work with no MiOS-specific command in the path: the mechanism is the one the
operating system already has. The content derives from the same SSOT that
renders ports, globals and launchers, so a verb renamed there renames its page.

No page carries a date. Two builds of one tree must produce identical bytes,
and the NO-HARDCODE law rejects dates in generated text.

A crate with no tests passes `cargo test` every time.

The workspace run prints `test result: ok. 0 passed` for each such crate, which
reads exactly like a crate whose tests all passed. Ten crates and roughly 5,600
lines are in that state, miosd alone being 3,550 of them, so the suite's green
says far less than it appears to.

The ceiling is shrink-only: a crate may be registered as untested with a reason,
and the count may only fall.

A task without a Verify line is a task anyone can call done.

Every field here exists because its absence let something through. Verify is an
exact command whose failure is the proof; Do NOT names the dodge that would
satisfy the task falsely -- raising a ceiling, wrapping a hint, spelling a check
name in a log line. Dep is checked because a dependency pointing at a
non-existent id is an ordering nobody can follow, and ids are counted because 25
of them are already used twice, which makes every Dep naming one ambiguous.

### The id below which the schema is not yet demanded. It lives...

The id below which the schema is not yet demanded. It lives in the SSOT as a
shrink-only ratchet, not as a constant here, so retro-fitting a batch of older
tasks is a measurable step rather than an edit nobody notices. A task marked
DONE is exempt whatever its id: it has already been done, so a Verify line
added now would be one nobody checked.

`## AGY-106..122 -- Campaign banner` covers every id in the range, so
a Dep naming one of them names a task that exists -- but the banner
plus its individual children is the NORMAL shape, not a collision, so
only individual headings count toward the duplicate ceiling.

### Prove the artifact gate can fail. `publish` depends on...

Prove the artifact gate can fail.

`publish` depends on `verify-images` to establish that the artifacts it is
about to push are real. The version that shipped ended on a failure counter
that stays zero when the glob loop matches nothing, so an empty build tree
passed it. A gate that cannot fail is worth less than no gate, because the
pipeline is built as though it were checking something.

So this drives the real verifier three ways -- an empty tree, a complete set of
fixtures, and the same set with one artifact removed -- and fails unless the
verdicts come back reject, accept, reject-naming-the-missing-format. It also
holds the wiring in place: the recipe must delegate here, `publish` must depend
on it, and every format the `all` target builds must declare where its output
lands.

### True for a file that declares itself a machine projection....

True for a file that declares itself a machine projection.

        The shell/PowerShell ceilings exist to drive HAND-WRITTEN glue down as it
        migrates to Rust. automation/lib/globals.{sh,ps1} are rendered in full from
        mios.toml, so they grow whenever the operator declares a config key -- growth
        that cannot be "earned back" except by deleting operator configuration. Counting
        them measured the wrong thing: a [cat] -> [field] rename that added keys pushed
        the PowerShell ceiling over its floor with no hand-written line involved.
        Excluding them LOWERS both floors by ~5.3k lines, so the ratchet binds strictly
        tighter on the code it actually governs.

One value, one name, ratcheted against the baseline ledger.

    Lifted out of its heredoc in the shell gate: 211 lines that nothing
    could import or lint, where a syntax error surfaced only when the
    check ran.

### resolve the live environment...

--- resolve the live environment -------------------------------------------
Git Bash cannot resolve an absolute path given as a script argument when
bash.exe is launched from Windows Python: both /usr/share/mios/... and /c/MiOS/...
exit 127 "No such file", because /c is resolved against the MSYS root
rather than the drive. The same file runs when passed RELATIVE to a cwd.
The gate passes an absolute $ROOT, so on Windows this check reported "the
resolver produced no environment" -- a gate that could not run at all,
rather than one that passed or failed.

### Return (current, what-write-mode-would-produce) for path....

Return (current, what-write-mode-would-produce) for path.

        check-mode used to compare only the VALUE, via a tolerant
        minsize\s*=\s*"..." regex, while write-mode ALSO normalised the
        spacing. So a file carrying aligned padding passed --check and was
        still rewritten by the generator: the gate reported in-sync on a file
        the generator would change. A check that does not compare what the
        writer produces cannot detect the drift the writer creates, so both
        modes now derive from this one rendering.

### Verify every deployment format the SSOT declares actually...

Verify every deployment format the SSOT declares actually produced a file.

The gate this replaces walked a glob list and ended on the failure counter, so
a tree with no artifacts in it counted zero failures and returned success --
and `publish` depends on it to prove the artifacts are real before the push.
The required set is now derived from `[deploy.formats]`: every format that
declares output globs must match at least one file, that file must clear the
size floor, and its leading bytes must be the ones its format is defined by.
