blocks_boot = false is Law 12: enrolment never gates a boot.
federate = "native": peers join via each system's OWN mechanism -- k3s
server/agent join, corosync membership -- automatically, never by hand.

Keys the Python and Rust resolvers do not agree on. Shrink-only.
The parity check never ran until the binary was found in target/debug,
so this is the first measurement, not a regression. AGY-1676 drives it
to zero by making one implementation authoritative.

Values that differ for keys both resolvers emit. The remainder is
Python's repr of nested arrays/tables, which needs preserve_order on
the toml crate to match -- AGY-1676, with a toolchain that can link.

Installed on a runner before the unit tier.

A hand-written list was wrong twice in a row: server.py's import chain reaches
smolagents through mios_gateway_queue and mcp through the module after that,
and each missing name cost a CI round trip to discover. The agent-pipe already
declares what it needs, so the runner installs THAT and the list cannot drift
from the code again.

The MiOS product line, named once. Each variant used to be a different shape:
an edition entry, its own table, or only a machine name. status is measured:
shipping means built and observed, partial means the machinery runs but not
the whole job, design means specified with no artifact.

What it takes for a built artifact to count as real. The verifier walked the
tree, matched nothing and reported success, so a build that produced no file
at all satisfied the gate that guards the push. Every format above names the
glob its own target writes; a format whose globs match nothing is a missing
artifact, and no artifact at all is the loudest failure of the set.

[rust] -- what the Rust layer's green actually covers.

`cargo test --workspace` prints "test result: ok. 0 passed" for a crate with no
tests, which reads exactly like a crate whose tests all passed. Every entry
below is in that state. The ceiling is shrink-only: write a test, remove the
entry, lower the number.
