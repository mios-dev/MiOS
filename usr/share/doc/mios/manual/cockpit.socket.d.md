Explicit 0.0.0.0:<port> (IPv4) -- the bare `ListenStream=<port>` form
resolves to [::]:<port> dual-stack on dual-stack-by-default Linux,
which appears as `*:<port>` in ss output. WSL2's NAT-mode
localhostForwarding does NOT forward dual-stack binds; only explicit
IPv4 listens reach the Windows-side 127.0.0.1:<port>.
systemd does NOT expand ${VAR} / ${VAR:-default} in ListenStream -- it
fails "Failed to parse address ... Invalid argument" and the socket
then refuses with "Unit has no Listen setting", so cockpit never binds.
The port is therefore a LITERAL mirroring mios.toml [ports].cockpit
(MIOS_PORT_COCKPIT); keep the two in sync.

WSL2 Windows-side port forwarder (wslhost.exe) keeps 9090 mapped for
a short window after the Linux process exits, so the next boot of
the same distro hits EADDRINUSE on cockpit.socket and the unit fails
with "Failed with result 'resources'". ReusePort lets the kernel
bind anyway -- safe because cockpit.socket is the only listener
that ever wants 9090 inside the distro.
