#### Overview

The roadmap recorded the risk-tier sandbox as computed-and-discarded: an argv
assembled and never `exec`'d. Running it settled the question differently.

Under `mios-sandbox-exec --level enforce`, a confined verb really does run
under bubblewrap — `/proc/1/comm` reads `bwrap`, a write outside the bind set
fails read-only, and the network is gone. What the same process also reported
was `Seccomp: 0`. The filesystem and the network were jailed; the **syscall
surface was not**. `mount`, `ptrace`, `keyctl`, `bpf`, `init_module` and
`perf_event_open` were all reachable from inside a jail that read as strict.

#### <a name="62_no_libseccomp"></a>62.No libseccomp: A Filter in 31 Instructions

`bwrap --seccomp FD` wants a compiled classic-BPF program, which normally means
linking libseccomp. It does not have to. The program the sandbox needs is small
and entirely regular:

```
ld  [4]                  ; seccomp_data.arch
jeq AUDIT_ARCH_X86_64  ->  next  else  DENY
ld  [0]                  ; seccomp_data.nr
jeq <denied nr>        ->  DENY  (once per denied syscall)
...
ret ALLOW
ret ERRNO(EPERM)
```

That assembles in pure `struct.pack`, so the filter has no build dependency and
unit-tests as data. The default action is `EPERM` rather than a kill: the
Done-When asks for a denied syscall to be *denied instead of succeeding*, and
an errno is both what that means and far easier to diagnose than a process that
vanished.

#### <a name="62_abi_not_trust"></a>62.The Number Table Is ABI, Not Trust

The one genuinely dangerous part is the syscall-number table. A wrong number
does not fail loudly — it denies **the wrong syscall**, quietly, forever. So
the committed table is not trusted: the sibling test re-derives it from the
host's own `asm/unistd_64.h` whenever those headers exist and fails on any
mismatch. A transcription error cannot ship past a glibc host.

That is also why only x86_64 appears. Numbers for architectures that could not
be verified here are absent rather than approximated, and an architecture with
no verified table **refuses** to produce a filter.

#### <a name="62_nothing_is_worse"></a>62.A Filter That Denies Nothing Is Worse Than None

Three refusals follow from one idea — an empty or malformed filter still shows
up as `Seccomp: 2` and still reads as protection:

* an unsupported architecture raises rather than emitting a program;
* a denylist that resolves to nothing raises rather than emitting a
  deny-nothing filter;
* a chain longer than the 255-slot jump range raises rather than truncating to
  a filter whose tail syscalls fall through to ALLOW.

The wrapper takes the same stance one level up. At `--level enforce`, if the
filter cannot be built the run is **refused with exit 126** — exactly what the
script already did for a missing `bwrap`. Confining a verb with no filter is
not a degraded success; it is a silent downgrade of a security control.

The program's own arch check follows the same rule: a mismatch jumps to DENY,
never to ALLOW. Letting a mismatched personality through is the classic
32-on-64 seccomp bypass, and the test asserts the jump target directly rather
than trusting the shape.

#### <a name="62_two_argv_builders"></a>62.Two Argv Builders, One Executor

`mios_sandbox.build_bwrap_argv` predates the wrapper and describes a *different*
confinement from the one that runs: `--unshare-all` where the wrapper unshares
pid/ipc/uts, and no `--cap-drop ALL` or `--seccomp`. It is a reference shape,
not the argv anything executes, and it is now labelled as such at its
definition. Reconciling the two is recorded as T-309 rather than done here —
quietly changing the flag set of a security wrapper that cannot be VM-verified
from this environment would be a worse outcome than a documented divergence.
