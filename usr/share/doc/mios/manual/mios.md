### Comment lexer + classifier for the generative documentation...

Comment lexer + classifier for the generative documentation system.

Spec: docs/design/doc-generative-documentation.md sections 1.2 and 2.

Two jobs, kept apart on purpose:

  lex(path)      -> the comment blocks in a file, with enough context
                    (attachment, anchor code, hashes) to place and track them.
  classify(b, ..) -> exactly one verdict per block, from an ordered first-match
                    rule set, so every decision is explainable by one rule id.

The classifier holds NO thresholds of its own. Every number arrives in a
`Policy` built from mios.toml `[docs]`, because a rule change must be an
operator edit to SSOT rather than a code edit (Law 7 NO-HARDCODE, Law 8
SSOT-PROJECTION).

Taggability and comment syntax are NOT redefined here. They are loaded from
usr/libexec/mios/mios-ai-tag through the same SourceFileLoader shim
mios-ai-hint-coverage uses, so "which files carry documentation" has exactly one
definition across all consumers.

<!-- mios-src:f6c3310f2a36 from usr/lib/mios/mios_comments.py:5-25 -->

### The files the census covers

The files the census covers: GIT-TRACKED only, sorted.

    Walking the filesystem instead made the count depend on whatever untracked
    or ignored files a particular machine happened to have -- vendored trees,
    scratch dirs, staging dumps. The number then differed between a contributor
    box and CI, which silently loosened the ratchet ceiling in CI to the point
    that its negative test could not breach it. Tracked files are the same set
    everywhere.

### Import usr/libexec/mios/mios-ai-tag (no .py suffix) as a...

Import usr/libexec/mios/mios-ai-tag (no .py suffix) as a module.

    Same SourceFileLoader approach mios-ai-hint-coverage already uses. Returns
    None when it cannot be found, so callers can degrade rather than crash.

<!-- mios-src:28a9e30776f6 from usr/lib/mios/mios_comments.py:85-89 -->

### Every name a comment could legitimately reference. A...

Every name a comment could legitimately reference.

    A reference counts as dangling only when it is absent from here AND absent
    from the tree AND not allowlisted. Without this filter the staleness rule
    drowns in false positives -- the survey needed it to get from 353 raw hits
    down to ~70 real ones.

Python uses tokenize + ast, never regex.

    Regex miscounts multi-line data strings as prose -- the survey proved it on
    the AI-plane files, where a system-prompt literal reads exactly like a
    narrative comment block.

### R4 BANNER DELIBERATE NARROWING of the spec's second clause....

R4 BANNER

DELIBERATE NARROWING of the spec's second clause. As written it is
"<= 8 words AND no sentence-final punctuation AND not WHY -> DROP", which
also swallows ordinary short comments ("bump the retry count",
"guard against zero") -- and DROP is a class that `prune` may delete.
Information safety is absolute here, so a short block must additionally
LOOK like a label -- ALL-CAPS, Title Case, or a trailing colon -- before it
can be treated as a divider. Pure divider runs are unaffected.

### (vendor, vendor_d, host, host_d, user, user_d) resolved...

(vendor, vendor_d, host, host_d, user, user_d) resolved from the env at
    CALL time. Vendor FRAGMENTS live in /usr/lib/mios/mios.d (Law 1 USR-OVER-ETC
    + systemd's /usr/lib vendor convention), NOT beside the /usr/share monolith;
    admin/user fragments sit in a mios.d/ beside their monolith.

<!-- mios-src:69fb3387c633 from usr/lib/mios/mios_toml.py:52-55 -->

### The overlay layer paths, lowest precedence first, EXPANDED...

The overlay layer paths, lowest precedence first, EXPANDED to include
    drop-in fragments. Resolved from the environment at CALL time (not import
    time) so a caller / test / CI on a non-FHS host can retarget a layer via
    MIOS_VENDOR_TOML / MIOS_HOST_TOML / MIOS_USER_TOML / MIOS_TOML_ROOT (and the
    *_TOML_D fragment-dir overrides) AFTER this module is imported.

    Ordering is TIER-MAJOR (vendor < host < user); within each tier the monolith
    seeds LOWEST, then that tier's mios.d/*.toml fragments (lexical basename)
    deep-merge over it. Tier is the primary precedence key -- a vendor fragment
    can NEVER outrank a higher tier (the XDG/git-config scope model, not
    systemd's global flat sort). NO-OP when no mios.d/ exists: every _frags()
    glob is empty and this returns exactly [vendor, host, user] as before.

<!-- mios-src:982133a0fda5 from usr/lib/mios/mios_toml.py:69-80 -->

### Allocate every [ports] value from the [ports.categories]...

Allocate every [ports] value from the [ports.categories] schema, IN PLACE.

    This runs AFTER layer merging, so it is the live runtime allocator: a
    factory/OEM default in the vendor mios.toml, an operator override in
    /etc/mios/mios.toml, or a user override in ~/.config/mios/mios.toml all feed
    the same derivation and the result is what every consumer sees -- userenv.sh
    exports, /etc/mios/install.env, the Quadlet render, the firewall phases and
    the Containerfile build args.

    A member's port is  base + index_in_members * stride.  Because `members` is
    ordered, adding or removing a service reallocates the category with no hand
    edit and no chance of a collision. `pinned` entries are protocol contracts
    (DNS/53) and are emitted verbatim.

    The flat [ports] table in the vendor file is a rendered projection kept for
    readability and drift-gating; the derivation OVERRIDES it, so an operator who
    retargets a category base is never silently beaten by a stale vendor literal.

<!-- mios-src:d55cbc3df935 from usr/lib/mios/mios_toml.py:136-153 -->

### Allocate ports from [ports.categories] AFTER every layer...

Allocate ports from [ports.categories] AFTER every layer (and the DB
overlay) has merged, so operator/user overrides of a category base or
member list re-derive live instead of losing to the vendor flat table.

### Fixtures for mios_comments. Every classifier rule gets at...

Fixtures for mios_comments.

Every classifier rule gets at least one fixture that asserts the exact
(cls, reason) pair. A rule with no fixture is a rule nobody has proven fires --
this repo has a documented history of checks that could not fail, so the bar
here is that each rule is demonstrated, not merely written.

Runs standalone (python3 test_mios_comments.py) so it needs no pytest in the
bake image.

### Folder default = "MiOS" -- NOT the distro name. Earlier...

Folder default = "MiOS" -- NOT the distro name. Earlier versions
wrote to %APPDATA%\...\Programs\<distro>\ to match Microsoft's
native WSL2 Start Menu sync, but Microsoft's wslservice TREATS
that folder AS ITS OWN: every WSL distro restart it re-enumerates
apps from the distro side using a much more restrictive filter
(NoDisplay + Terminal filtering plus its own ad-hoc rules), then
DELETES every .lnk in the folder that doesn't match. Result:
operator goes from 46 properly-iconed apps to 3 after `wsl
-shutdown`. Operator-flagged "no apps on windows
again!!!" -- the second time the WSL stomp wiped the shortcuts.

Writing to a distinct folder lets MS manage its 3-app distro
folder and lets MiOS own its 46-app folder side-by-side. They
appear next to each other in Start Menu.

PNG -> ICO converter that EMBEDS the PNG bytes inside an ICO
container. This is the Vista+ "PNG-encoded ICO" format Windows
Start Menu renders cleanly at every size from 16x16 to 256x256.

Why NOT .NET's Icon.Save() / Bitmap.GetHicon: those produce
single-image .ico files in 32-bit BMP format with a 32x32 source,
which Windows upscales badly at 256x256. The resulting Start Menu
tile shows either a generic icon or a blurry mess. Operator-flagged
twice: "no icons match", "NEVER saw native icons -- NOT
even ONCE". A PNG-embedded ICO matches what flatpak / Microsoft
Store / WSL's own sync produce.

Format (Vista+ PNG ICO):
  ICONDIR     (6 bytes): 00 00 | 01 00 | 01 00
  ICONDIRENTRY (16 bytes per image):
    bWidth(1)   bHeight(1)  bColorCount(1)  bReserved(1)
    wPlanes(2)  wBitCount(2)  dwBytesInRes(4)  dwImageOffset(4)
  Image data: raw PNG bytes (NOT XOR/AND masks like classic ICO)

### Force the Shell to re-read .lnk IconLocation values WITHOUT...

Force the Shell to re-read .lnk IconLocation values WITHOUT
nuking the icon cache database -- previous version called
`ie4uinit.exe -ClearIconCache` which dropped every Start Menu
icon to blank until Explorer was manually restarted. Operator-
flagged "the icons disappeared now!!!".

Lighter approach: touch every .lnk mtime + the SHChangeNotify
broadcast. The Shell watches .lnk mtimes for change; touching
invalidates the per-shortcut icon cache entry without affecting
other Start Menu items.

Sweep ALL .lnk files in our managed folder so renamed / removed apps
don't leave orphan shortcuts. Also clear the legacy `<distro>` folder
(where shortcuts USED to land before Microsoft's wslservice started
stomping it on every distro restart) -- if it still has our
leftover .lnks, they'll appear in Start Menu as duplicates next to
the new MiOS Apps folder.

### NATIVE WSL filename pattern

NATIVE WSL filename pattern: "<App Display Name> (<distro>).lnk".
Matches the exact convention WSL's built-in sync uses, so the
operator sees one consistent set of shortcuts (ours + WSL's
native sync share the same filenames -> de-dup at write).

─── "MiOS Full Desktop" Enhanced Session shortcut ───────────────────
Alternate launch path that opens the full GNOME desktop via mstsc.exe
connecting to the xrdp service in the dev VM. Set up by automation/
35-xrdp-enhanced-session.sh at install time. Lives alongside the
per-window app shortcuts in the same MiOS Apps folder so the operator
can pick per session (per-window for native-Windows-window feel,
Full Desktop for libadwaita-uniform rendering + Bibata cursor).
Operator directive "Full Enhanced Session is an alternate
launch option installed at irm|iex invoke and installation".

<!-- mios-src:ef9ce2ef6f33 from usr/libexec/mios/Update-MiOSStartMenuShortcuts.ps1:395-403 -->

### Nested GNOME approach

Nested GNOME approach: WSLg launches /usr/bin/mios-full-desktop in
the distro, which exec's gnome-session inside `gnome-shell --nested`.
Mutter runs as a Wayland CLIENT of WSLg's Weston, hosting the entire
GNOME desktop in one window. All cursor + theme + decoration rendering
happens INSIDE that nested compositor -- bypasses every WSLg-per-window
rendering limit at once (Bibata + rounded corners + libadwaita-uniform
everything just work because Mutter draws final pixels itself).

### mios_tools -- the in-sandbox Code Mode tool API (WS-2)....

mios_tools -- the in-sandbox Code Mode tool API (WS-2).

This module is the LOCAL Python API the model's generated code imports INSIDE the
coderun-sandbox. It is the whole point of Code Mode: instead of loading ~71
OpenAI function schemas into the model's context every turn, the model writes
ordinary Python that calls e.g.

    import mios_tools
    hits = mios_tools.web_search("local FOSS LLM serving 2026")
    print(mios_tools.json({"top": hits[:3]}))      # final line = filtered result

and only the FILTERED result returns to the model -- the big token win.

How a tool call leaves the jail
-------------------------------
The sandbox is Network=none + DropCapability=ALL, so the ONLY egress is the unix
socket the Quadlet already bind-mounts at /run/coderun.sock (see
mios-coderun-sandbox@.container). This shim sends a single newline-delimited JSON
request -- {"verb": "<name>", "args": {...}} -- over that socket and reads one
JSON response line back. The HOST side (the agent-pipe's Code Mode broker proxy)
listens on that socket, runs the verb through dispatch_mios_verb (so the broker's
permission / taint-firewall / dedup / HITL gates STILL apply per verb), and
writes the result back. There is NO direct verb execution inside the jail --
every call is mediated + policy-checked on the host.

Deploy: this file is mounted into the sandbox (read-only) as
/usr/local/lib/mios/mios_tools.py and put on PYTHONPATH so `import mios_tools`
resolves. Pure stdlib (socket + json) so it has no in-sandbox deps.

### Named window-snap region geometry (pure, no side effects)....

Named window-snap region geometry (pure, no side effects).

The rectangle math is intentionally free of hardcoded pixel constants: half /
quarter fills are computed from the LIVE work-area width and height, and the
right/bottom halves take the exact remainder so a pair of halves tiles the work
area with no gap or overlap on odd dimensions.

Compute the ABSOLUTE (x, y, w, h) for ``region`` from a screen-layout dict.

    ``layout`` matches the OS-control executor's /screen-layout contract:
    ``{"screens": [{"work": {"x", "y", "width", "height"}}, ...]}``. The chosen
    monitor's work-area origin is added to the relative rectangle. Returns None
    on an unknown region or an out-of-range / malformed monitor entry.

Standalone unit test for mios-docgen (WS-4 P0 doc-gen).

Pure stdlib; imports the CLI module by path (it has no .py extension, matching

resolution, the master gate, degrade-open emission, and the routing decision
table. The two backend converters (Pandoc / LibreOffice) are NOT invoked --
that needs the binaries + a graphical-free office runtime and is covered by the

Tests for the mios-find ranker SSOT (mios.toml [mios-find.ranker] +
[mios-find.category_priority]).

The ranker lives in an embedded python heredoc inside the bash script
``mios-find``. We extract that block, stub the ``mios-apps --json`` inventory
call, point ``MIOS_TOML`` at a temp config, exec it in-process, and assert the
chosen launch command. Defaults must reproduce the historical in-code ranking;
a non-default config must change it -- proving the weights are read from SSOT,
not baked.

### Quadlet sidecar enablement. Defaults policy (project-wide...

Quadlet sidecar enablement.

Defaults policy (project-wide invariant): every flag here defaults to
true. The system never disables a service via static config -- when a
service is incompatible with the host (wrong virtualization layer,
missing required path, missing hardware), systemd `Condition*`
directives in the Quadlet itself short-circuit it at boot/pre-boot
and the service silently no-ops. Operators can still override any
flag in /etc/mios/profile.toml or ~/.config/mios/profile.toml to
force-disable a service even when it would otherwise run.

FORCE-DISABLED (explicit exception to the defaults-true policy):
this sidecar's docker_start.sh corrupts the SHARED host /var/lib/crowdsec
(dangling /staging symlinks + `localhost` machine re-register) and needs the
online hub at boot (incompatible with offline MiOS) -- it crash-looped the
host crowdsec agent for ~6 days. Retired; the host agent provides the IPS.

### Names the SSOT defines

Names the SSOT defines: every MIOS_* key, every unit it declares.

        A comment naming MIOS_AI_ENDPOINT is referencing a key that exists --
        in mios.toml, not as a file. Without this the staleness rule reported
        every env var in the tree as a dangling reference, which is why its
        count was noise rather than a signal.

The allowlist holds literal reference tokens and globs -- paths like
'C:\mios-bootstrap\Get-MiOS.ps1', bare tokens like 'ollama' or
'8080', and globs like 'blade-*.conf'. It was matched with re.search,
under which the Windows paths are invalid patterns (bad escape \m)
and 'blade-*.conf' silently matches nothing it was meant to cover.

Characters of AI-hint prose, continuation lines included.

    Counting only the line that starts with `AI-hint:` would mean a hint could
    clear the cap by being wrapped across several `#` lines -- the gate would
    then be measuring line length, which nobody cares about, instead of how much
    prose sits in the header, which is the thing being ratcheted down.

hint_max_chars caps the AI-hint PROSE, not the whole header block.
AI-related/AI-functions/AI-doc are machine-maintained: their length
tracks how many files a module touches and how many functions it
defines, neither of which is a writing-quality signal. Counting them
made the ceiling unreachable -- check-fleet-safety.py carries 357
characters of generated metadata, so it breached a 260 cap even with
an empty hint, and no amount of editing could clear the gate.

A list of scalars stays comma-joined and unquoted, which is what every
consumer of a MIOS_*_LIST expects. A list of TABLES or of lists is
rendered as TOML inline syntax, matching mios-resolver.

str(dict) gives a PYTHON REPR -- {'ordinal': '01', 'fatal': True} --
which only Python can parse and which disagreed with the Rust
resolver's TOML inline tables on 12 keys. That was the whole residual
of check_resolver_differential_parity, sitting exactly at its ceiling
of 12 with no headroom (T-1063). TOML wins because it is a real

### image.sidecars.* emits BOTH MIOS_<X>_IMAGE and...

image.sidecars.* emits BOTH MIOS_<X>_IMAGE and MIOS_<X>_VERSION
from one key (get_aliases / aliases.rs), so without this split the
two names carry an identical value and the tree gains 23 new
duplicate-value groups -- exactly what value-dup-baseline.tsv says
to collapse rather than record. Dropping the split here was tried
and reverted for that reason.

It is still the ONLY one of three emitters that splits, which is
T-1065's real finding: the fix is to stop emitting the redundant
_VERSION alias in both twins, not to change how it is rendered.
That removes 23 keys and needs its own change.

### Resolve ${MIOS_*} that one emitted value makes to another....

Resolve ${MIOS_*} that one emitted value makes to another.

    Twin of resolve_cross_references in tools/native/mios-resolver/src/emit.rs
    (Law 13), and public because both the resolver and the drift gate call it.

    Apply it where the consumer CANNOT expand: systemd EnvironmentFile= and
    podman --env-file read a value literally, so an emitted
    MIOS_AI_ENDPOINT=http://localhost:${MIOS_PORT_AGENT_PIPE}/v1 means one thing
    to bash and another to them. It is also why system-sync-env.sh DROPPED that
    variable rather than emitting it: its filter rejects any value containing
    `$` (T-1060).

    Do NOT apply it to the export map that renders automation/lib/globals.{sh,ps1}.
    Those are sourced by bash and PowerShell, which expand at load time, and the
    live reference is the feature: exporting MIOS_PORT_AGENT_PIPE before sourcing
    propagates into MIOS_AI_ENDPOINT. render-globals.build_exports() therefore
    returns the unexpanded map.

    Reads a snapshot so the result does not depend on dict order, leaves `$$`
    alone because systemd owns it, and leaves an unresolvable name verbatim
    rather than blanking it so a caller can report it.

### Law 12

Law 12: degrade open. set -euo pipefail is active, so without the guard
a Forgejo admin API that is not up yet fails the pipeline, fails the
assignment, and aborts firstboot on an egress failure. The empty-token
path below already handles it, and the repo-create call above uses the
same idiom (|| echo "000").

### mios-a2a-delegate -- mid-run agent-to-agent delegation over...

mios-a2a-delegate -- mid-run agent-to-agent delegation over A2A.

P2.2 (operator 2026-05-27 "collaborate not fan-out"): any in-flight
agent (Hermes, opencode, daemon-agent, ...) can hand a sub-task to a
registered A2A peer mid-tool-loop and inject the peer's answer back
into its own reasoning -- the substrate the audit identified as
missing ("scratchpad becomes a live bus, not read-only-after").

Internally this is a thin HTTP shim over the agent-pipe's
/v1/a2a/dispatch endpoint (which itself POSTs JSON-RPC
`message/send` to the chosen peer's /a2a surface).  Keeping the verb
as a normal broker-routed shim (rather than an in-process Python
import) preserves: (a) the dedup / single-flight guard in
dispatch_mios_verb, (b) the same audit + permission posture every
other verb gets, (c) compatibility with the [verbs.*] catalog the
planner already sees.

USAGE
  mios-a2a-delegate --peer <peer_id> --text <prompt>
  mios-a2a-delegate --skill <skill_name> --text <prompt>
  mios-a2a-delegate --peer <peer_id> --text <prompt> --context-id <ctxid>
  mios-a2a-delegate --list-peers
  mios-a2a-delegate --list-skills

OUTPUT (always JSON):
  {ok, peer_id, status, response, task_id, context_id}
  on failure: {ok:false, error}

### mios-a2a-discover -- SSOT-driven A2A peer discovery (no...

mios-a2a-discover -- SSOT-driven A2A peer discovery (no hardcoded endpoints).

Keeps the runtime peer list (/etc/mios/ai/v1/a2a-peers.json -- the file the
agent-pipe reads to know who it can delegate to) in sync with the fleet that is
actually LIVE. Candidates come from the SSOT, never from code literals:

  * always the local self (so single-node delegation still round-trips), and
  * every URL declared in mios.toml `[a2a].nodes` (the operator lists their
    fleet once), and
  * optionally a CIDR sweep when `[a2a].discover_cidr` is set (auto-find nodes
    on a LAN segment without naming each one).

Each candidate is probed for a valid MiOS A2A AgentCard; only responders are
written. Run on a timer / firstboot so node-spanning tracks the real fleet.
Every MiOS node ships the A2A server, so a live card == a delegable peer.

Agent-pipe port from SSOT (env MIOS_A2A_PORT / MIOS_PORT_AGENT_PIPE override,

Load the sibling mios-a2a-mdns module by path (hyphenated, extensionless
    filename) and return its mDNS browse candidates. Fully degrade-open: missing
    module / avahi absent / [a2a].mdns_discovery off -> []. Each candidate is
    card-probed below exactly like an explicit node, so a non-MiOS responder on the
    wire is never trusted blindly.

### mios-a2a-mdns -- avahi/mDNS advertise + browse for A2A peer...

mios-a2a-mdns -- avahi/mDNS advertise + browse for A2A peer discovery (FED-G5).

Two SSOT-gated, degrade-open halves that mios-a2a-discover calls (or an operator
runs standalone):

  * advertise -- when [a2a].mdns_advertise is true, render the static template at
    /usr/lib/mios/avahi/mios-a2a.service.in into /etc/avahi/services/mios-a2a.service,
    substituting the agent-pipe port ([ports].agent_pipe) and the service type
    ([a2a].mdns_service_type) from the layered mios.toml -- never a code literal.
    avahi-daemon watches that directory and (de)registers the service on file
    create/remove, so toggling the flag off removes the file = withdraws the
    announce, no daemon restart needed. Conservative default OFF (operator opts
    into a LAN announce).

  * browse -- when [a2a].mdns_discovery is true, run a one-shot
    `avahi-browse -p -r -t <type>` and parse the resolved (`=`-prefixed) records
    into http://IP:port candidate URLs. These are appended to the candidate set
    that mios-a2a-discover's EXISTING AgentCard probe validates before writing
    a2a-peers.json, so a non-MiOS responder on the wire is never trusted blindly.

Every external dependency (avahi-tools present, daemon up, template readable) is
optional: any miss logs and yields nothing, so discovery degrades to the explicit
[a2a].nodes / discover_cidr paths.

Render or withdraw /etc/avahi/services/mios-a2a.service per
    [a2a].mdns_advertise. Returns True when the desired state was reached.

### Parse one avahi-browse -p resolved (`=`-prefixed) line into...

Parse one avahi-browse -p resolved (`=`-prefixed) line into a candidate
    URL, or None.

    avahi-browse -p emits `;`-separated fields; resolved records lead with `=`.
    The documented field order (1-indexed) is:
        1 `=`  2 iface  3 proto  4 name  5 type  6 domain
        7 hostname  8 ADDRESS(IP)  9 PORT  10 txt...
    so positionally that is fields[7]=IP, fields[8]=port (0-indexed). The EXACT
    resolved field order can shift between avahi versions and cannot be verified
    offline, so we read those positions but VALIDATE structurally (IP must parse,
    port must be 1..65535); if the documented positions don't validate we scan
    the record for the first parseable IP followed by a valid port. The
    discriminators are structural (address-parse + integer range), not lexical.
    Names carry backslash escapes (\032 = space); we need only IP + port, so no
    unescaping is required to build the URL.

### Cached candidate URLs iff the cache is younger than `floor`...

Cached candidate URLs iff the cache is younger than `floor` seconds AND was
    written for the SAME service type, else None. Degrade-open: any error -> None
    (forces a fresh live browse). Liveness is NOT trusted here -- mios-a2a-discover
    re-card-probes every candidate, so a stale cache entry is simply re-validated.

One-shot mDNS browse for the A2A service type when [a2a].mdns_discovery is
    set. Returns a list of candidate http://IP:port URLs (deduped, order-stable)
    for mios-a2a-discover to card-probe. Honours the [a2a].mdns_refresh_sec FLOOR:
    a browse inside that window reuses the last live result (so discovery never
    loses peers between scans). Degrade-open: avahi-browse missing / daemon down /
    timeout -> [].

### mios-a2a-test -- A2A federation loopback smoke test...

mios-a2a-test -- A2A federation loopback smoke test (roadmap B5 / T-066).

Registers the local MiOS instance as its own A2A peer (loopback) and runs a
full JSON-RPC 2.0 ``message/send`` -> Task -> Artifact round-trip against the
``/a2a`` surface, then confirms the ``event`` table recorded the delegation
chain for the task's contextId. This is the first end-to-end federation smoke
increment: it proves the same /a2a path a remote peer would use works when a
MiOS speaks to itself.

USAGE
  mios-a2a-test --loopback            # run the round-trip; exit 0 on success
  mios-a2a-test --loopback --text "…" # custom probe prompt
  mios-a2a-test --loopback --json     # machine-readable result on stdout

Endpoint resolves from MIOS_AGENT_PIPE_URL (set from the mios.toml [ports] SSOT
via /etc/mios/install.env at runtime) -- identical to mios-a2a-delegate; no
literal port is baked into a decision. Unreachable endpoint => clear message +
nonzero exit, never a traceback (degrade-open: a dev checkout has no live lane).

Build an A2A Message with a single text Part (pure).

    Mirrors the shape mios_pipe.federation.a2a expects: role + parts[] where
    each part is {kind:text, text:...}; contextId threads the loopback turn so
    the delegation chain is queryable afterwards.

### Best-effort

Best-effort: count event rows recording this contextId's delegation

    the smoke verdict never hinges on the audit DB being live).

### 'MiOS' AdGuard Home first-boot config generator. Writes...

'MiOS' AdGuard Home first-boot config generator.

Writes /etc/mios/adguard/AdGuardHome.yaml from the [adguard] + [ports] SSOT in
mios.toml (layered: vendor /usr/share/mios/mios.toml < host /etc/mios/mios.toml)
plus two HOST-SPECIFIC values that can't be baked at image build time and are
discovered live here:

  * the Tailscale IPv4 (`tailscale ip -4`)  -> goes in dns.bind_hosts so tailnet
    peers can resolve at <vm-tailnet-ip>:53;
  * the MagicDNS suffix (`tailscale status --json`.MagicDNSSuffix) -> a split-DNS
    upstream rule  [/<suffix>/]<magicdns_resolver>  so *.ts.net pretty URLs keep
    resolving through Tailscale's MagicDNS while everything else goes upstream
    with ad-blocking.

Idempotent + non-destructive: if the config file already exists it does NOTHING
(AdGuard rewrites that file when settings change via the UI/API, so regenerating
would clobber the operator's changes). Delete the file to force a regen.

No hardcoded literals: every tunable comes from mios.toml; only the Tailscale
MagicDNS stub IP default lives in the TOML (it is a fixed, universal address).

    no-auth admin UI (it controls DNS for the whole tailnet once it's the global

    Otherwise auto-generate a strong random password, bcrypt it, and drop the
    plaintext in a root/825-only file the operator can read once. If bcrypt is
    unavailable, fall back to an OPEN (tailnet-bound) UI + a loud warning.

### mios-ai-hint-coverage -- ratchet gate for AI-hint header...

mios-ai-hint-coverage -- ratchet gate for AI-hint header coverage.

Taggability is NOT redefined here: this tool imports mios-ai-tag (the single
source of truth for which files should carry a header) and reuses its
walk()/existing_hint(). It only ADDS a pass/fail policy: untagged_count <= ceiling.

The ceiling (max permitted untagged files) is resolved, highest priority first:
  1. --max-untagged N            (CLI)
  2. $MIOS_AITAG_MAX_UNTAGGED     (env)
  3. [ai_tag].max_untagged        (mios.toml SSOT, layered: vendor < /etc < ~)
  4. permissive fallback          (report-only; never false-fails a bare checkout)

Why a ratchet, not a hard 100%: a few taggable files MUST stay header-free --
agent SOUL/prompt markdown (a `<!-- AI-hint -->` line would leak into the prompt)
and single-value data files (a comment would corrupt the value). The ceiling lets
those remain while failing the build the moment a NEW untagged file lands. Drive
the ceiling toward 0 as real code/config gets tagged (`mios-ai-tag`).

Usage:
  mios-ai-hint-coverage --root .                   # gate cwd (repo == system root)
  mios-ai-hint-coverage --root . --max-untagged 0  # require 100%

Set of walked paths that git IGNORES. Local gitignored scratch (e.g. a
    dev's tmp-*.py / audit_*.ps1 at repo root) is NOT shipped or tracked, so it
    must not count against AI-hint coverage -- otherwise any dev's local scratch
    reds `just drift-gate` / the CI PR gate / a repo-root build.sh run. The OCI
    bake already excludes it (only the copied usr/etc/tools/automation subset is
    in /ctx); this aligns the repo-root invocation with the in-image semantics.
    Degrade-open: git missing / not-a-repo / error -> empty set (count
    everything, the prior behaviour) so this never falsely passes a real gap.

'MiOS' AI-tagger -- a rich, agent-useful AI header on every file.

Goal (operator 2026-06-13): every file in both MiOS repos carries a header that
is descriptive of its USE + PURPOSE, the RELATED files/services it touches, and
the FUNCTIONS/entrypoints it defines -- so an agent knows what a file is for, what
it depends on, and what it exposes, without reading the whole thing.

Header block (comment-syntax + shebang aware, line-ending preserving):

Reuse keeps it cheap: an existing AI-hint is kept verbatim; only files lacking one
hit the teacher. JSON (no comments) + binaries are skipped.

Usage:
  mios-ai-tag --root /usr/share/mios --root /mnt/c/mios-bootstrap               --manifest /var/lib/mios/finetune/ai-tag-rich.manifest

mios-app-search <query> [--limit N] [--json]

Semantic search over the installed-app inventory. Calls agent-pipe's
/v1/app-search endpoint, which embeds the query + cosine-ranks against
the cached mios-apps inventory.

Use for ambiguous asks like "my note-taking app", "phone settings",
"the screenshot tool" -- substring against mios-apps misses anything
the operator phrases differently.

Returns top-k {category, name, description, launch, score}.

SSOT: mios-apps inventory is the source; this is a thin client.

localhost/ refs have no registry behind them -- podman pull can NEVER succeed

(57-mios-sys-build.sh) or deferred to the firstboot tier
([build.bake].firstboot_tokens -> plan.d/firstboot.list ->
mios-webtools-firstboot.service builds them on first boot). One landing in a

mios-bench -- agentic-capability benchmark harness for the MiOS agent plane.

The AIOS engineering blueprint flagged the absence of a standard capability
benchmark runner (SWE-bench / OSWorld / tau-bench). This is that harness.

  mios-bench score <results.json> [--k 8]
      OFFLINE. Reads a JSON list of trial records
        [{"task","ok","cost","latency_ms","error","security_violation"}, ...]
      (or {"results":[...]}) and prints the CLASSic rollup + mean pass@k / pass^k
      grouped by task. Pure -- no endpoint needed.

  mios-bench run <suite.json> [--k 8] [--endpoint URL] [--out results.json]
      Drives the agent-pipe endpoint. suite = JSON list of
        [{"task","prompt","expect": "<substring>" | ["any","of"]}, ...].
      Runs each task k times, marks ok when an `expect` substring is present,
      records latency, writes the results JSON. Needs the live :8700 lane.

Endpoint resolves from MIOS_AI_ENDPOINT (Law 5) -> default http://localhost:8700/v1.

Where this blade's services actually live, and whether they answer.
On a seat every target is REMOTE, so this is the one question a seat

like a broken model -- the lane resolver hands back its terminal lane
even when the probe fails, by design, so the turn degrades rather than
dead-ends and the transport error is all you see.

mios-cdp-fetch <url> [max_chars]

Deterministically fetch a page's rendered text via the ChromeDev CDP browser
(:9222) -- so the MiOS agent gets REAL page content instead of hallucinating
it (operator 2026-06-06: "cdp web browse in hermes"; gemma4 fabricated the
Wikipedia first sentence instead of reading the DOM). Ensures the CDP chrome is
up (mios-hermes-browser ensure), opens a fresh tab AT the url (PUT /json/new?url
navigates it), waits for document.readyState == complete, reads document.title +
document.body.innerText via Runtime.evaluate over the tab's CDP websocket, prints
one JSON line {url,title,text}, then closes the tab.

Headless + observational (no visible window): the same CDP surface the agent's
browser_navigate uses, exposed as a deterministic verb the pipeline can call so
the answer is grounded in the actual page, not the model's guess.

mios-chain-verify -- walk the MiOS event hash chain and report the first tamper.

The `event` table is an append-only observability stream; SEC-03 links every row to
its predecessor with a SHA-256 chain (chain_seq / prev_hash / chain_hash) at the
agent-pipe persist chokepoint. This tool independently RE-DERIVES the chain from the
stored rows and reports whether it is intact:

  * reads the chained rows (WHERE chain_hash IS NOT NULL) in chain_seq order via
    `mios-pg-query --exec-json` -- the pure-stdlib pg wire transport every confined
    agent-plane reader uses (no psql / psycopg / podman required);
  * recomputes each link with the SAME canonical_core + sha256 used on write,
    imported from the agent-pipe `mios_audit` module so the algorithm has ONE source
    of truth (no second copy of the crypto to drift);
  * prints `{ok, checked, first_broken_seq}` and EXITS NONZERO on a broken chain.

Exit codes:  0 = chain intact (or empty)   1 = tamper detected (first_broken_seq)
             2 = read / setup failure (cannot reach pg or import the verifier)

'MiOS' codebase index -- one descriptive line per file, for AI-agent discovery.

The operator directive (2026-06-13): "MiOS AI should be able to use the WHOLE
MiOS codebase ... all docs, scripts, functions ... every file tagged with a
descriptive header/hint for AI agents". This tool is the DISCOVERY half: it walks
the MiOS roots, pulls a one-line description from each file (in priority order:
an explicit `AI-hint:` marker -> YAML frontmatter `description:` -> a module/script
docstring or header comment -> first H1 -> first meaningful line), and emits a
single unified index. Agents read the index, see what exists, then read or run
the exact file -- the same filesystem-discoverable pattern as mios-docs-index
(no English-prose RAG auto-injection -> no locale contamination).

`mios-ai-tag` is the COMPLEMENT: it ensures every file actually HAS an `AI-hint:`
so this index is rich. Files lacking any description are reported via --gaps.

mios-coderun -- execute agent code in the bubblewrap sandbox (the `coderun`
verb backend). Completes the P4.4 sandbox loop: the sandbox (mios-sandbox-exec)
is now reachable AS A VERB, so an agent can run code SAFELY -- read-only system,
writable scratch workspace only, NO network egress by default, resource caps.

Distinct from `powershell_run` (Windows host shell) and `mios-coderun-session`
(the container dry-run/test boundary orchestrator): this runs a SHORT code
snippet / command in a per-call bwrap jail on the Linux side + returns its
stdout/stderr/exit, then discards the scratch dir.

USAGE
  mios-coderun --code '<source>' [--lang bash|python] [--net] [--timeout 60]
  mios-coderun --code 'print(2**10)' --lang python

OUTPUT (JSON): {ok, lang, exit_code, stdout, stderr, sandboxed, net}

mios-coderun-codemode -- WS-2 Code Mode runner (the `code_mode` verb backend).

Runs an AGENT-SUPPLIED code snippet inside the EXISTING rootless PODMAN
coderun-sandbox (concepts/coderun-sandbox.md) -- the defense-in-depth boundary
(Network=none, ReadOnly, DropCapability=ALL, seccomp allowlist, Landlock PID-1,
cgroups v2). This is the "Code Mode" half of the AIOS Tool Manager: the model
writes CODE that calls a small local tool API (mios_tools, the in-sandbox shim
copied alongside) instead of having ~71 OpenAI function schemas loaded into its
context; only the FILTERED result returns -- the big token win.

Distinct from its two siblings:
  * mios-coderun         -- bubblewrap (bwrap) per-call jail; the lighter
                            `coderun` verb backend. THIS uses the heavier podman
                            container instead (full Quadlet hardening + a warm,
                            conversation-scoped session).
  * mios-coderun-session -- the start/stop/snap/revert orchestrator for the same
                            podman sandbox; THIS calls it to ensure the session
                            is up, then `podman exec`s the snippet in.

DEFAULT-OFF + degrade-CLOSED: code execution only runs when [code_mode].enable is
set in mios.toml AND the podman sandbox image/unit are present. Any precondition
miss -> a clean refusal JSON, never an unsandboxed fallback (the one feature where
we degrade CLOSED, not open -- running model code outside the jail is a non-
starter).

USAGE
  mios-coderun-codemode --session <id> [--lang python|bash|sh] [--net]                         [--timeout 60]   < snippet-on-stdin

### mios-compact -- compact recent agent + system state into a...

mios-compact -- compact recent agent + system state into a single
markdown digest that can be ingested as an OWUI knowledge artifact.

Operator directive 2026-05-17: "make sure there's tools to compact
all this and artifact it natively for OWUI knowledge/database". The
agent stack generates a lot of latent state (recent chats, hermes
session decisions, daemon classifications, launch verifier failures,
git commits) that's useful for the agent to RAG against on later
turns. This helper pulls the lot, summarizes via the local CPU
model, and writes a versioned markdown file under
/var/lib/mios/compacted/. Pair with mios-knowledge-add to register
the file as a Knowledge collection in OWUI.

Sections in the rendered digest:
  1. Recent operator chats (last N user turns + agent responses)
  2. Launch verifier failures (from daemon)
  3. Recent hermes tool-call patterns
  4. Daemon classify summaries (system log roll-up)
  5. Git commits this session

Output: /var/lib/mios/compacted/<utc-iso>.md  (timestamped, never
overwrites previous digests; mios-knowledge-add picks the newest).

Usage:
  mios-compact                          # default: last 24h of activity
  mios-compact --since "12 hours ago"   # parseable by `date`
  mios-compact --chats 10               # cap chat count
  mios-compact --out <path>             # override output path
  mios-compact --stdout                 # print to stdout instead of file
  mios-compact --no-llm                 # skip the CPU summarization step

Exit codes:
  0 = digest written (or printed)
  1 = required state unreachable (OWUI db missing, llm-light down)
  64 = bad args

### mios-computer-use -- Linux/Wayland desktop computer-use...

mios-computer-use -- Linux/Wayland desktop computer-use executor for MiOS.

The Linux/Wayland peer of `mios-pc-control` (which drives the Windows host via
Win32 SendInput through the WSL broker). This tool drives the LOCAL Linux
graphical session -- bare-metal/VM GNOME or KDE on Wayland, or a wlroots
compositor -- with NO ydotool dependency (ydotool is AGPLv3 + seat-wide):

  * INPUT   -- the freedesktop RemoteDesktop portal (libei era; GNOME >= 45 /
               KWin >= 6.1 production) over D-Bus, with a persisted restore
               token for unattended re-use. Self-written `evdev`/uinput backend
               as the compositor-agnostic fallback (our own code -> MIT-clean,
               works on wlroots + headless seats too).
  * CAPTURE -- one-shot Screenshot portal, with grim / gnome-screenshot /
               spectacle CLI fallbacks (all FOSS, offline).
  * GROUND  -- AT-SPI2 a11y tree FIRST (role/name/text, no pixels, deterministic),
               vision grounding (mios-pc-vision -> qwen3-vl:4b baseline or the
               UI-TARS-1.5-7B vLLM `mios-grounding` lane) only when the tree is
               empty (Chromium/Electron/canvas).

ENVIRONMENT-ADAPTIVE (MiOS is a bootc image deployable on any hardware):
  1. [computer_use].executor_endpoint set + reachable -> route every op to that
     HTTP executor (federation: drive ANOTHER machine's desktop, same contract
     mios-pc-control uses for the Windows executor + mios-computer-use-server
     uses for Linux). Configured-but-down => honest error, never a blind local
     fall-back (mirrors the os_control executor rule).
  2. else local Wayland session (WAYLAND_DISPLAY present) -> portal/uinput.
  3. else WSL2 with a reachable Windows host -> delegate to mios-pc-control so
     the SAME verb works everywhere.
  4. else honest "no desktop backend available" error.

SUBCOMMANDS (contract-compatible with mios-pc-control so the cu_* verbs and the
dual MCP+A2A server are backend-agnostic):

Self-written /dev/uinput backend via python-evdev (BSD). No ydotool.

    Compositor-agnostic (works on wlroots + headless seats). Absolute pointer
    axes are sized to the current screen so (x,y) are real pixel coordinates.
    Needs the agent user in `input` + the uinput uaccess udev rule.

org.freedesktop.portal.RemoteDesktop (libei era) over D-Bus via Gio.

    Production on GNOME (>=45) and KWin (>=6.1). A linked ScreenCast stream
    defines the absolute-coordinate space; the restore token (interface v2)
    skips the consent dialog on subsequent unattended runs.

    NOTE: this path requires a live graphical-session portal and is validated
    on a real GNOME/KDE Wayland desktop (cannot be exercised headless). On any
    failure the caller falls back to the uinput backend.

### mios-computer-use-server -- dual MCP + A2A + REST-executor...

mios-computer-use-server -- dual MCP + A2A + REST-executor server for a
MiOS/Linux desktop node, so the central agent-pipe CONSUMES this desktop as a
first-class federated capability (full MCP AND A2A).

WEBSERVER: FastAPI + uvicorn (the SAME stack the agent-pipe runs on, from the
SAME shared venv /usr/lib/mios/agents/.venv). Hand-rolled, spec-faithful routes
-- NOT the official `mcp` / `a2a-sdk` packages -- because (1) the agent-pipe (the
CONSUMER) already serves MCP + A2A hand-rolled in exactly this style, (2) those
SDKs are pip-only with churny APIs (a2a-sdk >=1.0 dropped A2AStarletteApplication;
the mcp SDK has had mount/lifespan bugs) which an immutable air-gapped bootc
image must not depend on, and (3) fastapi/uvicorn/httpx are already present +
dnf-available offline. The surface is tiny (9 tools, 1 skill); interop is
guaranteed because the pipe's own MCP/A2A client consumes these exact shapes.

ONE capability, THREE HTTP surfaces, all backed by the local `mios-computer-use`:

  1. MCP -- Streamable HTTP transport (spec 2025-06-18) at /mcp:
       * POST /mcp  -- JSON-RPC: initialize / tools/list / tools/call. Returns
                       application/json (spec-legal for a stateless server; SSE
                       is OPTIONAL for request/response tool calls).
       * GET  /mcp  -- opens a text/event-stream keepalive channel (server->client
                       notifications); spec allows 405 but we serve a minimal SSE.
       * Origin validation (DNS-rebinding guard) + MCP-Protocol-Version tolerance.
     The pipe's MCP client (add this URL to /etc/mios/ai/v1/mcp.json) surfaces the
     tools as `mcp.<server>.cu.*` IN THE AGENT LOOP (_mcp_tool_to_openai_tool).

  2. A2A (Agent2Agent 0.3.0): GET /.well-known/agent-card.json advertises a
     `desktop-control` skill; POST /a2a is JSON-RPC (message/send + message/stream
     via SSE); GET /a2a/contexts/{id} shares inter-agent context. The pipe (add
     this URL to /etc/mios/ai/v1/a2a-peers.json) DISCOVERS the skill + DELEGATES
     whole desktop tasks via _a2a_send_message_to_peer.

  3. REST executor contract: GET /health|/screenshot|/windows|/screen-layout,
     POST /input/*, /window/*, /atspi/query, /ground -- the SAME contract the
     Windows mios-oscontrol-server.ps1 speaks, so a central node's
     mios-computer-use with executor_endpoint=<this> routes fine-grained ops here.

SECURITY: bind LOOPBACK by default; reach it over the tailnet via
[computer_use].bind_address + firewall to the tailnet (mios_tailscale pattern).
Optional bearer token ([computer_use].auth_token) gates write surfaces. Require
A2A passport signing at the pipe for cross-host delegation. Every op runs through
the local mios-computer-use, which honours the DoD/approval gate.

CONFIG (layered mios.toml [computer_use]): server_port, bind_address,
allowed_origins, auth_token.

### mios-crawl -- native CRAWL verb backend (fetch a URL ->...

mios-crawl -- native CRAWL verb backend (fetch a URL -> clean markdown).

Reads ONE web page and returns LLM-ready markdown so agents GROUND on the
ACTUAL page content instead of a search snippet or a fabrication. Thin HTTP
client for the local mios-crawl4ai service (loopback FastAPI) -- the slow
crawl4ai/camoufox import + browser-attach is kept WARM in that service, so
each `crawl` verb call is just a fast loopback POST (same shape as
mios-web-search -> SearXNG).

  --- engine flow (operator directive 2026-05-24) ---
  PRIMARY  : crawl4ai drives the EXISTING local Chrome over the DevTools
             Protocol (ws://127.0.0.1:9222, the ChromeDev flatpak that
             mios-hermes-browser.service keeps up). crawl4ai ATTACHES to
             that browser via BrowserConfig(browser_mode="custom",
             cdp_url=...) -- NO bundled/downloaded Chromium.
  FAIL-RETRY: if the CDP crawl errors / is blocked / returns near-empty
             markdown, the SAME url is retried with Camoufox (stealth
             anti-detect Firefox). Camoufox ships its own patched Firefox.
  HONEST-FAIL: if both engines fail, this prints success:false with an
             error -- it NEVER invents page content.

Companion to mios-web-search: web_search (SearXNG) finds candidate URLs;
crawl reads the chosen one. Agent flow: search -> pick URL -> crawl ->
answer from the fetched markdown.

SSOT (env rendered from mios.toml [crawl] via globals/userenv):
  MIOS_CRAWL_SERVICE_URL  base URL of the local crawl service
                          (default http://127.0.0.1:${MIOS_PORT_CRAWL4AI:-8810})

Usage:
  mios-crawl <http(s)-url> [--max-chars N] [--camoufox] [--timeout S] [--json]
    --camoufox   force the Camoufox stealth path (skip Chrome CDP). Used by
                 the smoke test to confirm the fail-retry engine works.
    --max-chars  truncate returned markdown (0 = no limit; default 20000)
Output: JSON {success, engine, url, title, markdown, links}

crawl4ai service down (e.g. image not built) -> fall back to the lighter
    mios-web-extract single-page reader (no heavy crawl4ai/Chrome stack needed)
    so `crawl` still GROUNDS on real page content instead of hard-failing.
    Returns {} if the fallback also fails (then the honest-fail stands).

### 'MiOS' cron-director -- minimal LLM-gated recurring-task...

'MiOS' cron-director -- minimal LLM-gated recurring-task scheduler.

Reads /etc/mios/cron-rules.toml ([[rule]] name/cron/do/gate per the vendor
schema), and once per minute fires each rule whose 5-field cron expression
matches the current local minute:

  * no `gate`  -> fire `do` immediately;
  * `gate`     -> ask the micro-LLM a YES/NO question (with a little live system
                  state); fire on YES, skip+log on NO. Default on gate ERROR is
                  SKIP -- a gated rule asked for a condition we couldn't verify,
                  so we do NOT fire it blindly.

`do` runs via `bash -lc <do>`, DETACHED (fire-and-forget) so a long task never
blocks the minute loop; stdout/stderr go to the journal. A per-minute dedup
state file (/var/lib/mios/cron-director/state.json) prevents double-firing.
SIGHUP reloads the rules without a restart. Stdlib only -- no croniter.

Operator 2026-05-26: built to make "do X every N minutes" actually recur (the
service was referenced in the preset + mios.toml but the daemon never existed).

### 'MiOS' schedule manager -- add/list/remove cron-director...

'MiOS' schedule manager -- add/list/remove cron-director rules.

The `schedule` verb dispatches here. `add` translates a human interval
("30 minutes", "hourly", "daily", or a raw 5-field cron) into a cron
expression, stores the PROMPT text in /var/lib/mios/cron-director/prompts/
<name>.txt (kept OUT of the shell `do` line so there is no injection), writes a
[[rule]] to /etc/mios/cron-rules.toml whose `do` is
`mios-scheduled-research --rule <name>`, and SIGHUPs the daemon to reload.

Usage:
  mios-cron-schedule add --prompt "<text>" --every "<interval>"
  mios-cron-schedule list
  mios-cron-schedule remove --name <name>

mios-cu-verify -- visual verification of desktop state.

Takes a natural-language description of an expected state (e.g. "terminal is open")
and asks the local vision LLM (default qwen3-vl:4b) if the state is currently
true on the screen. Returns JSON:

    {"ok": <bool>, "reasoning": "..."}

USAGE

### mios-cursor-apply -- set the X11 root-window default cursor...

mios-cursor-apply -- set the X11 root-window default cursor to the MiOS
cursor theme.

Operator trace 2026-05-19: under WSLg, WebKit content + GTK *widgets*
(links, text) show Bibata because they set NAMED cursors explicitly, but
the window CHROME (Epiphany frame, Nautilus, gnome-software) shows the
wrong cursor. Cause: GTK4 leaves a toplevel's ambient/idle cursor unset,
so it falls back to the X SERVER's default cursor -- and nothing themes
that under sessionless Xwayland (no gsd-xsettings / XSETTINGS daemon, no
session to set the root cursor; xsetroot/xrdb/xsettingsd aren't installed).

Fix: XDefineCursor the Bibata `left_ptr` onto the root window. Toplevels
with no explicit cursor inherit the root cursor (X11 cursor inheritance),
so the chrome themes correctly. Uses libX11 + libXcursor directly (both
present -- Xwayland/GTK link them); no package install.

Idempotent + safe: no-op without a DISPLAY. Per-X-session (the root cursor
resets if Xwayland restarts), so it's invoked on interactive login from
/etc/profile.d/mios-cursor.sh. Theme + size come from mios.toml
[theme.cursor_linux] (SSOT).

### mios-daemon -- consolidated MiOS micro-LLM daemon. Operator...

mios-daemon -- consolidated MiOS micro-LLM daemon.

Operator directive 2026-05-17: "ALL to be consolidated to one mios
daemon/agent". Replaces three separate journal-subscribing /
periodic-evaluating services (mios-log-watcher + mios-agent-nudger
+ mios-cron-director) with ONE process that:

  * Subscribes to journald ONCE (not three times)
  * Holds a SINGLE /v1 client (keep_alive=-1 forever, num_gpu=0
    CPU-only per Law 7 + the operator's "always-on agentic OS"
    directive)
  * Dispatches three handlers off a single event stream:
      - classify: every Nseconds-batch of journal lines summarized
                  via qwen3:0.6b-cpu (was: mios-log-watcher)
      - refusal:  every hermes-agent.service response judged by the
                  micro-LLM -- refusal / hedge / fabrication instead
                  of doing the work? (was: mios-agent-nudger; the
                  English refusal-pattern pre-filter is deleted -- the
                  judge is authoritative, degrade-open when its lane
                  is unreachable)
      - cron:     /etc/mios/daemon/cron.toml gates evaluated on a
                  cadence; YES gates fire their action (was:
                  mios-cron-director)
  * Writes a UNIFIED state file at /var/lib/mios/daemon/state.json
    with all three handler outputs. mios_sidecar_filter.py polls
    this single file (replaces the three SIBLING_AGENTS entries).

Architecture per Law 7 OFFLINE-FIRST: all LLM calls go to the local
mios-llm-light OpenAI /v1 lane at /v1/chat/completions (MiOS is
/v1-only; the server owns thread/offload placement). Thinking-mode
models' output is read from message.content first, then
message.reasoning_content / message.reasoning fallback (qwen3.5-family
puts CoT in those fields).

For the OWUI sidecar filter: state.json keys map 1:1 to the prior
SIBLING_AGENTS labels so the filter just reads ONE file instead
of three. Per-section sub-objects let the filter format each
category exactly as before. Schema:

    {
      "ts": <epoch>,
      "classify":    {"summary":..., "tags":[...], "severity":...,
                      "event_count":..., "events_sample":[...]},

Read top-level [daemon] scalar keys from the layered mios.toml

    do `or []` / _ok_result(None) -> []), exactly as the dead backend resolved to
    but WITHOUT the per-call 3s timeout + 30s backoff. Writes are already mirrored
    to pgvector at the _db_create chokepoint (_pg_insert); translated reads go
    through _db_read's pg path. Kept as a stub (signature incl. `timeout`) so the

    pg-disabled). WS-A3: when `params` is given, the values are BOUND out-of-band
    ($1..$n) via `mios-db --pg-json` -- the select_sql must use placeholders, not
    f-string-spliced values. Without params, the legacy `mios-db --pg` path runs
    a constant SQL string.

### Agent-plane READ seam (mirrors agent-pipe's). When pg is...

Agent-plane READ seam (mirrors agent-pipe's). When pg is ENABLED AND a
    pg_sql translation is supplied, run it and wrap the rows in the legacy
    [{"result": [...]}] envelope so _ok_result parses both shapes UNCHANGED. Else
    the legacy DB.

    WS-A3: gated on _PG_ENABLED (not _PG_PRIMARY) -- in the DEFAULT 'dual' mode
    the legacy DB (:8000) is retired and dead, so a _PG_PRIMARY gate left every
    translated read (satisfaction monitor, refine scan, ...) hitting the dead
    backend and returning [] (the documented training/telemetry-starvation bug).
    Reading the live pgvector mirror in dual is correct (daemon writes already
    mirror to pg) and strictly non-regressive: a missing/bad translation still
    falls back to the legacy DB -> [] (degrade-open), same as before, and pg responds
    instead of timing out + arming the 30s backoff. Reads WITHOUT a pg_sql still
    go to the legacy DB (-> [] until translated). pg_params (when the pg_sql uses
    $1..$n placeholders) are bound out-of-band -> injection-safe.

<!-- mios-src:00e4d6e1996e from usr/libexec/mios/mios-daemon:284-298 -->

### WS-A3

WS-A3: write a row to Postgres+pgvector via _pg_insert (parameterized) and
    return "" -- the agent-plane DB is pg now. Callers wrap this in
    `_db_post(_db_create(...))`; _db_post is a no-op stub (legacy DB retired), so
    returning "" makes the legacy write vanish cleanly with NO call-site change.
    `now_fields` (datetime cols) are omitted from the insert so the pgvector
    column DEFAULT now() applies; `now_fields`/`extra` are vestigial (were the
    legacy time::now()/clause shaping) and kept only for signature compat.

### Best-effort highest GPU-utilization-% across NVIDIA GPUs...

Best-effort highest GPU-utilization-% across NVIDIA GPUs via
    nvidia-smi. Returns -1.0 when nvidia-smi is missing / errors / has no
    GPUs (degrade-open: caller treats <0 as 'no GPU signal').

<!-- mios-src:23c16fb456c0 from usr/libexec/mios/mios-daemon:429-431 -->

### Return {over_ceiling, load_per_core, gpu_util, reason}...

Return {over_ceiling, load_per_core, gpu_util, reason} using a
    ~PRESSURE_TTL_S cached probe (so 4 loops sharing one tick don't run
    nvidia-smi N times). over_ceiling is True only when a configured
    ceiling (>0) is exceeded. NEVER raises -- on any probe error it
    reports over_ceiling=False so the caller proceeds as today.

    Note: over_ceiling reflects the raw measurement; whether a tick is
    actually SKIPPED is the caller's decision gated on PRESSURE_SKIP.

### True when a tick of `loop_name` should be skipped for host...

True when a tick of `loop_name` should be skipped for host pressure.
    Writes a 'deferred (host pressure)' marker into state.pressure for
    operator visibility on EVERY over-ceiling observation (even when
    PRESSURE_SKIP is off, so the operator can see what WOULD be deferred
    before enabling). Returns True only when PRESSURE_SKIP is also set.

<!-- mios-src:c886ff1cb6d7 from usr/libexec/mios/mios-daemon:499-503 -->

### Call qwen3:0.6b-cpu (or whatever MODEL is) via the OpenAI...

Call qwen3:0.6b-cpu (or whatever MODEL is) via the OpenAI /v1 lane.
    Returns the model's text output (content with thinking fallback).
    Returns empty string on any error. Always uses CPU + keep_alive=-1.

    num_thread tunes the CPU inference width: the always-on BACKGROUND loop
    keeps the default 4 (~2c, light), while the FOREGROUND daemon-agent
    reasoner (the consolidated mios-cpu/reasoner lane) passes a wider count
    (8c/16t) so a pipeline turn bursts -- operator 2026-05-24 '2c background /
    8c foreground'. On the OpenAI /v1 surface (MiOS is /v1-only) the server owns
    thread/offload config, so these CPU knobs no longer shape the request.

First N normalized tokens of a summary -- a coarse fingerprint that
    treats near-identical classifications (same root cause, trivially
    different tail) as the same event.

### Record a fingerprint hit; return True when an identical...

Record a fingerprint hit; return True when an identical fingerprint
    was seen within CLASSIFY_DEDUP_S (so the caller suppresses the heavy
    write and emits a count-only update instead). Degrade-open: if dedup is
    disabled (CLASSIFY_DEDUP_S<=0) it never suppresses.

<!-- mios-src:52a205ed4c16 from usr/libexec/mios/mios-daemon:657-660 -->

### Gate a repeat escalation of the SAME concern. Returns False...

Gate a repeat escalation of the SAME concern.

    Returns False while the concern is inside ESCALATION_COOLDOWN_S of its last
    escalation, and permanently once it has been escalated
    ESCALATION_MAX_ATTEMPTS times (the concern is parked and only logged after
    that). Degrade-open: a non-positive cooldown disables the gate entirely.

<!-- mios-src:e859dc613fb0 from usr/libexec/mios/mios-daemon:685-691 -->

### MODEL-DRIVEN

MODEL-DRIVEN: ask the micro-LLM whether `message_text` is the assistant
    refusing / hedging / fabricating instead of doing the work. Returns True or
    False when the judge classifies, or None to signal DEGRADE-OPEN (detector
    off, empty input, or judge lane unreachable/unparseable) so the caller skips
    this turn's check instead of fabricating a refusal verdict. No English-regex
    pre-filter gates the call -- every candidate response is judged.

<!-- mios-src:aed695c7769a from usr/libexec/mios/mios-daemon:853-858 -->

### MODEL-DRIVEN

MODEL-DRIVEN: ask the micro-LLM whether `assistant_text` claims a launch
    and, if so, what target was claimed. Returns {"app": <str>} when it is a
    verifiable claim with a usable target, {} when the model says "not a claim",
    or None to signal DEGRADE-OPEN (detector off or lane unreachable) so the
    caller skips this turn's claim check instead of fabricating one.

### Every LAUNCH_VERIFY_TICK_S seconds, scan recent OWUI chats...

Every LAUNCH_VERIFY_TICK_S seconds, scan recent OWUI chats for
    assistant launch-success claims and verify each via
    mios-window-active. Persist mismatches so the agent (and operator)
    can see which launches were false-success.

    Already-verified claims are deduped by (chat_id, app, claim_ts)
    via the persisted failures file (kept compact at <= 50 entries).

4B: resolve an OS-control NODE name -> its executor base URL from the
    layered mios.toml [os_control.nodes.<node>].endpoint (vendor +/etc; /etc
    wins -- that's where the operator's real tailnet endpoint lives, NEVER the
    public repo). Returns '' when unknown/unset.

### True when fire_result shows the IN-SESSION executor...

True when fire_result shows the IN-SESSION executor (:11437) presented a
    window. The executor runs ON the operator's interactive desktop, so its
    "presented"/launched verdict is AUTHORITATIVE -- the Linux-side
    _verify_one_launch (pgrep + WSL window probe) cannot reliably see a
    Windows-host window and false-reports no-window for a Store game the executor
    already presented (operator 2026-05-30 Wreckfest). Parses the
    '[mios-windows] launched via in-session executor: {json}' line. Best-effort.

### FIRE a launch + run the success-check as ONE operation...

FIRE a launch + run the success-check as ONE operation, returning the
    consolidated verdict the agent reads: {app, fired, launched, verdict,
    ...}. NEVER raises. With `node` set -> delegates to that REMOTE node's
    executor (4B). Otherwise the LOCAL path: fire `mios-launch <app>` (the
    same command open_app's dispatcher renders) THROUGH THE BROKER (the only
    context with the WSLg display env), then POLL _verify_one_launch until the
    window is presented or attempts run out. The daemon is the SOLE firer (if
    it's unreachable the shim returns an honest error and the agent falls back
    to plain open_app).

Call the local /v1 lane via its OpenAI-compatible /v1/chat/completions
    endpoint with response_format=json_object (operator directive:
    'native for OpenAI API standards'). Returns parsed dict; {} on
    any failure (fail-open -- the loop just skips a tick).

<!-- mios-src:918195111427 from usr/libexec/mios/mios-daemon:1646-1649 -->

### Phase A.2

Phase A.2: kernel-event-driven mutation bus.

    Watches /var/lib/mios/* scratchpads + state dirs via inotify.
    Each mutation -> one DB event row with source=fs-watcher,
    kind=fs_change, payload={path, op, size, preview}. Other agents
    subscribe via `SELECT FROM event WHERE source = 'fs-watcher'
    AND ts > <last_seen>` instead of polling individual files.

    Debounces per (path, op) at 1Hz so a noisy write loop doesn't
    flood the event table. Tolerates missing/added dirs: creates the
    watched dirs at startup; warnings on add-watch failure don't kill
    the thread.

### Pull tool_call rows that landed AFTER a refine event in the...

Pull tool_call rows that landed AFTER a refine event in the
    same session. The refine event's payload doesn't directly link
    to a session_id (refine runs on the prompt, session is opened
    separately), so we fall back to a ts-window match: tool_calls
    within `lookback_after_min` minutes after the refine.
    Best-effort -- if the linkage misses, the satisfaction verdict
    is "no_tools_seen" rather than wrong.

### SSOT

SSOT: map a dispatched tool name -> its post-check SIGNAL from the
    layered mios.toml [daemon.post_check] (vendor < /etc < per-user; later
    layer wins). The check IMPLEMENTATIONS live in this module keyed by
    signal name -- this table only decides WHICH check guards WHICH verb,
    so coverage is operator-tunable instead of baked into the dispatch.
    Returns {} when unreadable -> every verb degrades-open to bare
    tool_call.success.

<!-- mios-src:a1cfc02a4f17 from usr/libexec/mios/mios-daemon:2079-2085 -->

### Cross-check that a launch/focus verb actually put a window...

Cross-check that a launch/focus verb actually put a window on the
    operator's screen. A broker can return exit 0 after its sandbox died
    at credential bootstrap with the window never having appeared.

<!-- mios-src:e95dfe0ece2d from usr/libexec/mios/mios-daemon:2102-2104 -->

### Per-verb visible-outcome verification beyond...

Per-verb visible-outcome verification beyond tool_call.success.
    Dispatches the check implementation named by the verb's SSOT-declared
    signal (mios.toml [daemon.post_check]); the raw success column alone
    misses launches whose sandbox died after the broker collected exit 0.

    Returns dict {checked: <bool>, passed: <bool>, signal: <name>,
    detail?: <str>}. checked=False means no post-check applies to this
    verb (it is unlisted, or its signal has no implementation) -- the
    caller falls back to tool_call.success alone.

### Batch-upsert directory_entry rows via the legacy DB....

Batch-upsert directory_entry rows via the legacy DB.

    Datetime handling: the legacy backend rejects bare ISO strings for
    TYPE datetime fields -- the canonical literal is
    `<datetime>"2026-05-19T..."`. We bypass _db_create for this
    batch path and format CREATE statements directly with the
    right literal shape. _db_create's now_fields mechanism works
    for indexed_at (= "now") but not for mtime (which needs to
    preserve the file's actual mtime).

    Counts: per-statement ERRs come back inside the 200-OK
    response. We walk the response list to count actual successes
    vs the previous bug where wrote == sent regardless.

<!-- mios-src:2590494ac9b9 from usr/libexec/mios/mios-daemon:2402-2414 -->

### R15

R15: mirror the directory index into pgvector. The directory_entry
    writer bypasses _db_create (datetime literal shaping), so it never hit the
    _pg_insert chokepoint -- this is its dedicated pg path. DELETE the root's
    rows then batch-INSERT (ON CONFLICT(path) update). Runs in dual+postgres
    modes. Degrade-open via _pg_exec (mios-db --pg).

<!-- mios-src:5370723845d5 from usr/libexec/mios/mios-daemon:2461-2465 -->

### Delete all directory_entry rows for this root_label, then...

Delete all directory_entry rows for this root_label, then
    insert the fresh entries. Safer than UPDATE-by-path because
    deleted files actually disappear from the index instead of
    persisting as stale rows.

### Operator 2026-05-21

Operator 2026-05-21: consolidate the stored log_digests into a concise
    ROLLING REPORT. Every MIOS_DAEMON_REPORT_S, read the recent med/high
    digests from the DB, ask the micro for ONE short report, and store it
    (state.json `report` + a log_digest report row). Cheap + idle-aware:
    skips the LLM entirely when nothing notable accumulated.

<!-- mios-src:a260a1d779cc from usr/libexec/mios/mios-daemon:2630-2634 -->

### The consolidated CPU lane (operator 2026-05-24...

The consolidated CPU lane (operator 2026-05-24 "mios-daemon-agent =
    mios-cpu/reasoner! CONSOLIDATE"): the always-on daemon-agent IS the CPU
    reasoning lane now. It REASONS on the CPU model (the same model/endpoint the
    retired mios-reasoner-cpu used -- qwen3:1.7b @ the CPU lane :11435, num_gpu 0)
    via the proven think=False llm_chat() path, GROUNDED in the live global
    journal/log telemetry the daemon already maintains. So it contributes a real
    second-opinion answer that is system-state-aware -- NOT the raw telemetry
    dump that forced the old fanout=false (the model folds telemetry in ONLY
    when the request concerns the system, and ignores it otherwise). Bursts to
    8c/16t (AGENT_THREADS) for the foreground turn. Empty -> the fan-out cleanly
    drops this secondary.

### mios-directory-lookup -- query the cached directory map...

mios-directory-lookup -- query the cached directory map that
mios-daemon's index_loop maintains in PostgreSQL/pgvector.

Operator directive: "mios-daemon should be indexing directories for
directory maps for llms cache/lut/DB/etc for faster navigation/
recall!!". This shim is the read-side of that index. Sub-100ms
lookups (DB query) vs the 60ms+ live mios-find / fs_search.

The query is parameterized end-to-end: every external value (the
search substring + the --root / --ext / --kind filters) is bound
out-of-band via `mios-db --pg-json` ($1..$n through the pg v3 extended
protocol), never spliced into the SQL text. Only the integer LIMIT is
inlined (int()-coerced).

USAGE
  mios-directory-lookup <query> [--root <label>] [--ext <.md>]
                                [--kind <file|dir>]
                                [--limit N] [--json]

OUTPUT
  Default: human-readable list of ranked hits.
  --json:  {ok, query, hits: [{path, kind, size, mtime, summary,
                              root_label, score}, ...]}

### Directory lookup against pgvector via the parameterized...

Directory lookup against pgvector via the parameterized
    `mios-db --pg-json` envelope (pg v3 extended protocol -- values bound
    out-of-band as $1..$n, never spliced into the SQL text). Returns the
    rows list, or None when pg is unreachable so the caller degrades open
    (empty result, no crash). strpos() substring match; ranking happens in
    the shared pass below. Only the integer LIMIT is inlined (int-coerced --
    text->int inference is unreliable on the bound path).

### mios-discord-send -- DETERMINISTIC Discord post/DM helper....

mios-discord-send -- DETERMINISTIC Discord post/DM helper.

Posts a message to a Discord CHANNEL (--channel <id>) OR direct-messages a USER
(--user <@name|id>, or a NON-NUMERIC --channel value treated as a username): it
resolves the username via guild member-search, opens a DM channel, and posts.
So "send @someone a message on discord" is an ACTION the MiOS orchestrator performs
directly -- NOT something the executor narrates and lies about (operator
2026-05-22), and NOT a fabricated channel URL (operator 2026-06-10). Honest JSON
result so the caller reports the REAL outcome (sent / why-not), never a fake.

[redacted] (from /etc/mios/hermes/discord.env or env).
Target:  --user <@name|id> for a DM; --channel <id> (or non-numeric @name) ;
         else MIOS_DISCORD_DEFAULT_CHANNEL (mios.toml [identity].discord_channel_default).

Discord is the operator's own external service (a chat sink), not a cloud-AI
dependency -- consistent with Architectural Law 5 (no vendor-cloud AI URL).

### mios-docgen -- FOSS, fully-offline document generation for...

mios-docgen -- FOSS, fully-offline document generation for MiOS (WS-4 P0).

The computer-use "Worker" half that PRODUCES artifacts (pptx / docx / xlsx /
pdf / html / md) instead of clicking through an office GUI. Built from MiOS
parts -- Pandoc (markdown <-> docx/pptx/html/pdf) + LibreOffice headless
(`soffice --convert-to`, the universal office-format converter) -- so it stays
FOSS + offline (NO Wide-Moat / BSL vendor stack, per aios-implementation-plan
section 0-B).

Two jobs, one contract:
  * `convert`  -- any input file -> any output format (LibreOffice for office
                  binaries; Pandoc for markup; auto-routed by extension).
  * `build`    -- author a NEW document from markdown/text/CSV source content
                  (Pandoc for docx/pptx/html/pdf; native CSV->xlsx via
                  LibreOffice). The agent writes markdown, we emit the binary.

DEFAULT-OFF / GATED + DEGRADE-OPEN (binding rule): the whole tool is gated by
[computer_use].docgen_enable (env MIOS_DOCGEN_ENABLE), default false. When off,
every subcommand returns a structured {"ok": false, "error": "...disabled..."}
JSON and exit 0 -- callers degrade gracefully (the verb is visible but inert)
rather than crashing. A missing backend binary likewise degrades to an honest
JSON error, never a stack trace.

SSOT: every tunable resolves from layered mios.toml (vendor < /etc < ~/.config)
[computer_use], overridable by MIOS_DOCGEN_* env. NO literals baked in code --
the defaults here are the documented fallbacks, mirrored in mios.toml.

USAGE
    mios-docgen convert <in-path> <out-path> [--to FMT]

soffice --headless --convert-to <filter> --outdir <dir> <src>.

    LibreOffice writes <src-stem>.<ext> into --outdir; we then move it to the
    requested out path. A private per-call profile dir avoids the singleton
    lock that makes concurrent/headless soffice silently no-op.

### mios dotfiles

mios dotfiles: project the mios.toml SSOT dotfiles to the operator's live HOME (ADR-0010).

Thin, read-only-by-default orchestrator over mios-theme-render:
  status        list registered surfaces, which apply to THIS platform, and
                whether each is up-to-date or would-change (engine dry-run).
  diff [names]  show what `sync` WOULD write to live HOME (writes nothing).
  sync [names]  apply every apply-eligible surface to live HOME (backup-safe,
  apply         HOME-scoped -- both guaranteed by the engine, not us).
An optional trailing surface-name list narrows diff/sync to those surfaces
(passed straight through to the engine); default is every registered surface.

<!-- mios-src:4cbe639cb630 from usr/libexec/mios/mios-dotfiles:6-16 -->

### Verb exit code

Verb exit code: a fatal engine error (rc 3 -- template/registry bug) is
    propagated; a HOME-scope refusal is a soft failure (rc 1) so scripts notice
    without aborting a run of many surfaces; otherwise success. Platform skips
    NEVER fail (degrade-open).

### Merge two lists of objects BY a stable `key` field (neither...

Merge two lists of objects BY a stable `key` field (neither input mutated):
    a foreign (base) element whose key is NOT in `owned_list` is PRESERVED in base
    order; an owned element whose key matches a foreign one deep-merges OVER it in
    place (owned wins, foreign sub-keys of that element preserved); an owned-only
    element is APPENDED after the foreign ones. The caller has already verified
    every element is a dict carrying `key` (see _keyed_object_list).

### Deep-merge the MiOS-`owned` subtree onto `base`...

Deep-merge the MiOS-`owned` subtree onto `base` (insertion-ordered):
    recurse where BOTH sides are objects; a MiOS-owned leaf/array/object-over-
    non-object wins; arrays are REPLACED wholesale at the owned pointer (index-
    merge is unsafe) EXCEPT at a pointer listed in _ARRAY_MERGE_KEYS whose two
    lists are keyed-object lists -- there they merge BY KEY (foreign elements
    preserved, owned wins per key); any key `owned` does not carry is preserved in
    base's order. New owned keys append after the foreign keys. `pointer` is the
    JSON pointer of the CURRENT node ("" at the root), extended per recursion so
    the array-merge lookup is position-exact.

### Splice the MiOS-owned JSON subtree (owned_text) onto...

Splice the MiOS-owned JSON subtree (owned_text) onto base_text (a foreign
    JSONC document), returning pretty JSON text (base indent, ensure_ascii=False,
    trailing newline). Foreign keys byte-preserved; owned wins; arrays replaced

### Parse a git-config/INI document into an ORDERED line-model...

Parse a git-config/INI document into an ORDERED line-model + an index.
    model: list of per-physical-line dicts. Every line keeps `raw` verbatim (so
    a foreign line round-trips byte-for-byte); a kv line additionally carries
    lead/key/sep/val/eol so an OWNED value can be replaced in place without
    disturbing its neighbours. index: {(section_lower, subsection_or_None,
    key_lower) -> model idx} for each kv line, so a PRESENT owned key is found
    and a foreign key is left untouched. Section headers and #/; comments are
    preserved as opaque `other` lines. Uses splitlines(keepends=True) so each
    line's own terminator (CRLF/LF/none) survives the round-trip.

Reverse a @MIOS:<sec>_<key>@ token to the mios.toml (section, key) that

    injected by _resolved_for) or <section>_* (the surface's settings section);
    returns None for anything else (e.g. a bare palette token), so a literal
    owned value is never treated as operator-set.

### This file says "lossless" at the top, and it was not. `env`...

This file says "lossless" at the top, and it was not. `env` prints a
multi-line value across several lines, and the old `grep '^MIOS_'` kept only
the FIRST of them -- continuation lines do not start with MIOS_, so the rest
was dropped without a word. Measured: MIOS_OWUI_SYSTEM_PROMPT_TEMPLATE is 2633
characters over 42 lines and reached the baseline as the nine characters
"# MiOS AI"; MIOS_DOCS_BOILERPLATE_WHAT_MIOS_IS lost 214 of its 288 (T-1066).
check_value_aliases trusts this output, so a gate was comparing mutilated
values confidently.

Refusing to emit a multi-line value was the other option and is worse here:
two of them exist, so the baseline could never be generated at all. The value
is escaped onto one line instead, which keeps every consumer's KEY=value parse
working and puts the whole value in the committed baseline's diff. Backslash
is escaped first, so the transform is reversible.

`read -d ''` over `env -0` is the only way to read a value whose own content
contains newlines. An awk with RS="\0" is not portable across awk
implementations, and this script must not grow a python dependency.

ONE resolver, always the shell twin. This snapshot is a committed BASELINE that
CI re-derives and diffs, so it must depend on the tree alone. Preferring the
native mios-resolver when tools/native/target/debug happened to be built made
the output depend on BUILD STATE: the Rust path emits shell-QUOTED values
(MIOS_X='a b') while the shell path emits raw ones (MIOS_X=a b), so the same
commit produced two different baselines and whichever machine regenerated last
broke the gate for the other. The twins are proven equivalent by
check_resolver_twin_parity / check_resolver_twin_equivalence; this file just
needs the reproducible one.

'MiOS' fine-tuner -- HARDWARE-AGNOSTIC LoRA/SFT of a small role model.

Trains a LoRA adapter on the distilled corpus from `mios-finetune-dataset`, then
exports it as a GGUF LoRA adapter for the llama.cpp / mios-llm-light lane. MiOS ships the components
to train on ANY hardware combination, so this auto-detects the compute device:

    NVIDIA CUDA  ->  4-bit QLoRA (bitsandbytes) when available, else bf16 LoRA
    AMD ROCm     ->  bf16/fp16 LoRA (torch+ROCm; bitsandbytes 4bit only if present)
    Apple MPS    ->  fp16 LoRA on the unified-memory GPU
    CPU-only     ->  fp32 LoRA (works everywhere; slow -- a fallback, not a goal)

Portable core = PyTorch + transformers + PEFT + TRL SFTTrainer (run anywhere);
Unsloth is used only as an OPTIONAL CUDA fast-path when present + prefer_unsloth.

OPERATOR-GATED + OFFLINE: the framework (see finetune/requirements.txt) and the HF
base ([finetune].hf_base) are one-time fetches you do once; thereafter training is
fully local. This is NOT an agent verb -- nothing in a chat turn can start it.

Honest: every stage guards its prerequisites and reports what actually happened
(trained / why it could not). Run with --dry-run to validate config + device +
deps + dataset WITHOUT training (no GPU work).

### 'MiOS' fine-tune dataset builder -- SELF-DISTILLATION, no...

'MiOS' fine-tune dataset builder -- SELF-DISTILLATION, no hardcoded English.

Builds a supervised fine-tuning (SFT) corpus for a small MiOS role model by
distilling a STRONG local teacher into it. The pipeline is deliberately grounded
in the LIVE system surface, so the dataset tracks the real install and carries no
hand-written topic list (operator rule: no hardcoded English / topics / keywords):

  1. Pull the LIVE verb catalog (name + description) from the running agent-pipe
     (/v1/verbs/openai-tools) -- the real routing surface, 61 verbs today.
  2. For each capability, the TEACHER generates N short, diverse, realistic user
     requests that would route to it (the model writes the English, never this file).
  3. The TEACHER also generates queries for the non-dispatch intent classes
     (pure chat, web/world lookup, broad multi_task) seeded by the schema's OWN
     definitions -- again, the model writes them.
  4. (optional) Mine REAL operator queries already stored in the knowledge table.
  5. Each query is LABELLED by the teacher against the live refine schema + catalog
     -> a refined-intent JSON matching exactly what the pipe parses.
  6. Emit chat-format JSONL ({"messages":[system,user,assistant]}) ready for TRL
     SFTTrainer / Unsloth.

Honest by construction: every example is the teacher's real output; nothing is
fabricated. Run with --limit N for a fast smoke check (a couple of capabilities).

Config: [finetune] in mios.toml (layered: vendor < /etc/mios < ~/.config/mios),
overridable by MIOS_FINETUNE_* env. Needs only stdlib + the running pipe.

### 'MiOS' fine-tune server -- serve a trained role adapter on...

'MiOS' fine-tune server -- serve a trained role adapter on ANY hardware.

Loads the base + the LoRA adapter from [finetune] (base+PEFT, the clean artifact that
works everywhere transformers runs) and exposes the OpenAI /v1 surface MiOS speaks
(MiOS is /v1-only):

  POST /v1/chat/completions    (OpenAI-compatible)
  GET  /v1/models , GET /healthz

So adopting the fine-tuned refiner is a one-line config change -- point the pipe's
refine endpoint at this server (e.g. MIOS_REFINE_ENDPOINT=http://127.0.0.1:11438) and
its model at [finetune].output_tag. Deliberately a STANDALONE helper, NOT auto-enabled:
the trained 2B served via transformers is correct but slower than the baked llama.cpp
lane on the hot path, so use it to A/B-test now; switch production to it once the
mainline llama.cpp GGUF path serves the adapter (then the same adapter runs fast).

Hardware-agnostic (auto cuda/rocm/mps/cpu). Stdlib HTTP only -- no extra deps beyond the
fine-tune venv (torch/transformers/peft). Run with the venv python:
  /var/lib/mios/finetune/venv/bin/python /usr/libexec/mios/mios-finetune-serve

### mios-firecrawl -- SCRAPE a web page to clean markdown via...

mios-firecrawl -- SCRAPE a web page to clean markdown via the LOCAL,
self-hosted Firecrawl API (the firecrawl-api member of the mios-webtools pod,
127.0.0.1:3002; offline-first, no cloud dependency -- Architectural Law 5).

WHY a SECOND fetch verb beside `crawl` (crawl4ai): they are DIFFERENT engines
with different strengths, and the operator wants ALL web tools globally
available to every agent. crawl4ai drives the local Chrome over CDP (best for
JS-heavy / login-walled pages that the standing browser already has state for);
Firecrawl is a dedicated scraper that returns very clean, LLM-ready markdown and
reliably renders news/article indexes (verified 2026-05-25: a scrape of a live
news index returned that day's real, dated headlines where SearXNG general
search returned only dictionary/brand junk). Give the agent both; let it pick.

SSOT: MIOS_FIRECRAWL_URL (rendered from mios.toml [ports].firecrawl). The
localhost:3002 fallback is the only literal, matching the pod publish.

Returns the SAME shape as mios-crawl so callers/ground-loops are uniform:
{success, engine, url, title, markdown, links}.

### mios-gen-role-system -- SSOT-driven AIOS-native role SYSTEM...

mios-gen-role-system -- SSOT-driven AIOS-native role SYSTEM generator.

Renders each MiOS agent role's SYSTEM prompt from the SSOT -- the layered
mios.toml `[agents.<name>]` config + the LIVE verb/skill/recipe catalog +
the A2A peer surface -- so the role models are intrinsically AIOS-native:
they NATIVELY decompose multi-faceted requests and delegate across the A2A
fleet, with NO hardcoded orchestration. The output is the SINGLE source
consumed by BOTH the mios-llm-light/Modelfile SYSTEM (the compiled-in fallback)
AND the agent-pipe per-role injection -- one SSOT, no drift, regenerated on
every image build.

NO HARDCODES: the tool surface + fleet awareness are read from the live SSOT
(mios.toml + /v1/verbs + a2a-peers.json), never written as literals. The only
static text is the AIOS-node IDENTITY (a role principle, not live env -- so it
is compatible with the no-context-injection rule, which is scoped to ENV
discovery, exactly like _recall_knowledge's allowed prior-answer injection).

### mios-handoff -- live state migration between model...

mios-handoff -- live state migration between model endpoints.

P5.5 (operator 2026-05-28 Hermes v2026.5.28 brief): "transition from a
massive model ... to a lightweight local model to complete routine
processing and save costs ... transfers the active execution session
... every conversation state, current tool output, and active variable
is serialized and migrated live to the target model without resetting
the workflow context."

In MiOS terms: pass the session's CURRENT A2A-context blackboard (the
shared scratchpad rendered as A2A Message history grouped by contextId,
served at /a2a/contexts/<ctxid>) + an optional handoff note to the
target peer/skill via the existing /v1/a2a/dispatch. The target receives
a clearly-framed "handoff take-over" message + can also fetch
/a2a/contexts/<ctxid> directly for the full history.

USAGE
  mios-handoff --to <peer_or_skill> --context-id <ctxid> [--goal <text>]
  mios-handoff --skill <skill> --context-id <ctxid> [--goal <text>]

DIFFERENCE FROM mios-a2a-delegate:
  delegate = "do this side task" (the calling agent stays in control)
  handoff  = "take over from here" (target inherits the session state
             and continues the workflow). Practically: the message is
             prefixed with a TAKE-OVER frame + carries a context summary
             pulled from /a2a/contexts/<ctxid>, so the target replies as
             the new owner of the workflow rather than producing a
             standalone answer to a delegated subtask.

### Yield (lineno, snippet) for a dated ATTRIBUTION baked into...

Yield (lineno, snippet) for a dated ATTRIBUTION baked into a .py STRING
    literal -- the hole that a date inside served CSS/JS-comment text or inside a
    system-prompt string slips through (the #-comment scan never sees string
    content). A date used as a VALUE is legitimate and exempt: a standalone or
    leading literal (a protocol-version id or a date config value is quote-led, so
    the char before it is the opening quote) or one glued into a URL/slug/identifier
    (preceded by a non-space joiner). The forbidden pattern is a date sitting in
    running prose -- structurally, one preceded by WHITESPACE and never the head of
    its own literal -- which is exactly how an `<attribution> <date>` credit reads.
    The discriminator is positional, not lexical (no keyword/English gate).

### A GENERATED file is exempt from the timeless-comment rule...

A GENERATED file is exempt from the timeless-comment rule: its
comments are PROJECTED from mios.toml `comment = "..."` values,
where a date is a value and legitimately exempt (the lint is
value-aware). It only becomes a #-comment once rendered, and a
"DO NOT EDIT" file cannot be hand-corrected -- the fix belongs
in mios.toml. Keyed off the file's own generated marker rather
than an allowlist, so it can never drift out of date.
Both tokens, and only in the file's own top banner -- a
GENERATOR mentions "DO NOT EDIT" in the header it EMITS, and
generators are authored files that must stay linted.

### In-place patch of gateway/platforms/discord.py to add...

In-place patch of gateway/platforms/discord.py to add progressive
"thinking" reactions on the operator's Discord message during agent
processing.

Operator directive 2026-05-18: "also add more reactions to the
MiOS-Hermes Discord bot--Should be using more discord reactions to
show it's thinking!"

Upstream hermes-agent's Discord gateway emits exactly two reactions:
  on_processing_start    -> 👀 (single "looking" emoji)
  on_processing_complete -> ✅ / ❌

That gives the operator no visibility into what stage the agent is in
mid-run. This patch enriches the reaction surface with a progressive
sequence:
    📡 (received)          immediate
    🧠 (thinking)          after 2s if still processing
    🛠️ (using tools)       after 8s if still processing
    ⏳ (still working)      after 20s if still processing
    ✅ / ❌ (final)         on completion (and all phase reactions
                            are cleared first so the final outcome
                            stands alone)

A background asyncio.create_task() drives the progression so the
gateway's normal flow isn't blocked. The task is stashed on the
gateway instance keyed by Discord message id so concurrent
in-flight messages each get their own task that the matching
on_processing_complete can cancel.

Idempotent: rerunning is a no-op once the marker comment is present.
Safe: if Discord's add_reaction / remove_reaction fail (rate limit,
missing perm), each call already swallows the exception in the
existing _add_reaction / _remove_reaction helpers, so the progression
degrades silently.

mios-ingest -- OFFLINE local-source ingestion into the viking:// vault.

P5.1 (OpenHuman ingestion, offline core): OpenHuman polls external SaaS
(Gmail/Slack/GitHub/...) -- that needs cloud creds + contradicts MiOS's
offline-first principle, so the EXTERNAL pollers are deliberately NOT built.
This is the OFFLINE half that IS aligned: ingest LOCAL sources (a directory of
notes/docs/markdown the operator already has on disk) into the second-brain
vault, tiered (L0/L1 via mios-summarize) so viking:// can navigate them and the
knowledge recall can surface them. Same "compact + structure + make navigable"
value, pulling from local files instead of cloud APIs.

Each ingested doc becomes a `knowledge` row (q = derived title/L0, answer =
the L1 overview + a pointer to the source path; the raw stays on disk as L2).
Idempotent per (source_path): re-ingesting updates rather than duplicates.

USAGE
  mios-ingest --path /var/home/mios/notes            # a directory (recursive)

Output JSON: {ok, ingested, skipped, sources:[...]}.
Offline: only mios-summarize (local CPU lane) + local pgvector. No network.

Storage: Postgres+pgvector via mios-pg-query. File-derived values (source path,
title/L0, L1 overview, embedding vector) are bound OUT-OF-BAND through the
parameterized extended protocol (mios-pg-query --exec-json $1..$n), never spliced

    the per-source failure (matches the old _sql contract). For statements that
    carry external (file-derived) values use _pg_param() instead -- it binds them
    out-of-band so nothing is ever spliced into SQL text.

### Run one or more parameterized statements atomically on...

Run one or more parameterized statements atomically on pgvector via
    `mios-pg-query --exec-json`, which reads a JSON envelope on STDIN and binds
    each param OUT-OF-BAND through the pg v3 extended protocol -- no string
    splicing, no escaping. `statements` is a list of {"sql": "... $1 ...",
    "params": [...]}; a multi-element list runs as an atomic BEGIN/COMMIT batch
    (used for the delete-then-insert upsert). Strings/vectors/text bind as params;
    INTEGER values (LIMIT, interval counts) must stay inline in the SQL. A vector
    is bound as a TEXT param with a ::vector cast in the SQL. Raises RuntimeError
    on a backend error so the caller's try/except records the per-source failure
    (matches _pg's contract).

Single-vector embed via the light-lane OpenAI /v1/embeddings
    (mios-llm-light :8500, nomic-embed-text, 768-dim) -- the SAME model+endpoint
    agent-pipe uses so cosine recall is comparable. MiOS is /v1-only: the OpenAI
    shape ({input} -> {data:[{embedding}]}). Returns a list[float] or None on ANY
    failure (network down, light lane swapping, bad shape) -- the caller then stores
    the row with emb NULL (still persisted + auditable, just not recallable). NEVER
    raises: embedding is best-effort and must not fail an ingest. Stdlib-only
    (urllib) to keep this offline tool dependency-free.

### mios-kg -- Personal Knowledge Graph CLI for the MiOS agent...

mios-kg -- Personal Knowledge Graph CLI for the MiOS agent stack.

Phase C.1 of the AgentOS roadmap. Manages the operator-preference data in
PostgreSQL/pgvector (person / app_install / alias + resolves_to natural-key
edge). The agent-pipe's kg_lookup() helper queries the same tables (JOIN on
app_id) to resolve ambiguous noun phrases to concrete launch targets. Mappings
are PER-OPERATOR data -- this CLI is the interface, never the source. NO
hardcoded English aliases in this codebase. (The legacy BSL 1.1 store is retired.)

Subcommands:
  bootstrap                Create the person row (from $USER /
                           $MIOS_USER) + ingest mios-apps inventory
                           into app_install rows. Idempotent.
  alias add <phrase> <target>
                           Add an alias. <target> can be:
                             app:<short_name>   (resolves to app_install)
                             "<short_name>"     (bare = app:<short_name>)
  alias rm <phrase>        Remove an alias.
  alias list               List all aliases + their resolves_to.
  lookup <phrase>          Print the lookup result for <phrase>.
  apps                     Print known app_install rows.
  who                      Print the person row.

Fully local: routes all reads + writes through the shared
/usr/libexec/mios/mios-db --pg-json CLI, which binds every value OUT-OF-BAND via
mios-pg-query's extended protocol (no value is spliced into SQL -> injection-
safe). resolves_to / app_install / alias / person tables are defined in
/usr/share/mios/postgres/schema-init.sql.

### mios-knowledge-add -- register a markdown file (or...

mios-knowledge-add -- register a markdown file (or directory of
markdown files) as files in OWUI's `file` table and link them into a
named Knowledge collection. The collection becomes RAG-able by the
MiOS-Agent model row's meta.knowledge binding.

Operator directive 2026-05-17: "make sure there's tools to compact
all this and artifact it natively for OWUI knowledge/database".
Pairs with `mios-compact` (which produces digests at
/var/lib/mios/compacted/digest-*.md) -- this helper drops them
into a "MiOS Session Memory" collection so the agent can RAG over
prior sessions.

Distinct from `mios-owui-apply-knowledge` which is specifically for
the FHS-sourced canonical docs (refreshes on hash drift). This one
takes ARBITRARY operator-supplied or daemon-produced files.

Usage:
  mios-knowledge-add <file-or-dir> [options]

Options:
  --collection <name>     Target collection name. Default:
                          "MiOS Session Memory".
  --description <text>    Used when creating the collection (first
                          add). Ignored if collection already exists.
  --replace               If the same filename already exists in the
                          collection, replace its content (default:
                          add a new entry with timestamped suffix).
  --tag <tag>             Add a tag to the file's meta. Repeatable.
  --dry-run               Print what would be done, exit 0.
  --db <path>             Override the OWUI db path (default:
                          /var/lib/mios/open-webui/webui.db).
  --attach-to <model_id>  Also bind the collection to the named
                          OWUI model row's meta.knowledge so the
                          model RAGs over it automatically. Default
                          target: 'mios-agent' (also tries
                          'mios_agent.mios-agent'). Pass empty
                          ('--attach-to ""') to skip binding.

Examples:
  mios-knowledge-add /var/lib/mios/compacted/digest-2026-05-17T21-40Z.md
  mios-knowledge-add /var/lib/mios/compacted/ --collection "MiOS Session Memory"
  mios-knowledge-add /tmp/incident-notes.md --tag incident --tag 2026-05-17

Files are stored with meta.managed_by = "mios-knowledge-add" so
mios-cache-clear preserves them (it spares non-MiOS-managed entries
based on this marker).

Exit codes:
  0 = files registered + linked (or no-op if --dry-run)
  1 = db unreachable / write failure
  2 = no files matched the given path
  64 = bad usage

### mios-knowledge-search -- query OWUI's RAG knowledge...

mios-knowledge-search -- query OWUI's RAG knowledge collections
from outside OWUI.

Operator directive: "OWUI's RAG databases are in-the-loop for all
agents globally and indexable for references". OWUI's pre-LLM
call hits its knowledge collections automatically when a model
has knowledge attached, but sub-agents (Hermes, opencode,
mios-daemon-agent, ...) running INSIDE the agent-pipe -> sub-agent
dispatch chain had no way to issue their own RAG queries -- so
they couldn't fetch context mid-tool-loop.

This shim wraps OWUI's /api/v1/retrieval/process/query endpoint
(the same engine OWUI's own pre-LLM call uses) so any agent can:

  - Search across all known collections (default).
  - Scope to a specific collection by name or id.
  - Receive ranked chunks WITH source metadata for citation in
    the polished reply.

USAGE
  mios-knowledge-search <query> [--collection NAME_OR_ID]
                                [--top-k N] [--threshold F]
                                [--json]

OUTPUT
  Default: human-readable bullet list of top hits.
  --json:  {ok, query, collection, hits: [{score, source, snippet}, ...]}

EXIT CODES
  0  query ran (any hits >= 0)
  1  no collections matched / OWUI unreachable / auth missing
  2  bad arguments

Resolve the OWUI admin api_key. Prefer a broker-readable secret
    (MIOS_OWUI_API_KEY env, or /etc/mios/owui-admin.key written 0640
    root:mios-ai by mios-owui-bootstrap-admin) so the agent-pipe / mios-ai user
    does NOT need read access to webui.db (0640 mios-open-webui) -- that
    permission gap is exactly why this returned '' and silently degraded to the
    pgvector fallback. Falls back to a read-only webui.db lookup for an admin/
    root caller. Never mutates webui.db.

POST /api/v1/retrieval/query/collection. Returns the parsed

    `collection_ids` is the list of collections to search (ALL of them when the
    caller didn't scope to one -- an empty list searches NOTHING, which is why a
    bare query used to return 0 hits). Endpoint shape verified against the
    running OWUI; earlier `/api/v1/retrieval/process/query` returned 405.

### mios-launcher-daemon -- operator-side launcher broker. Runs...

mios-launcher-daemon -- operator-side launcher broker.

Runs as the operator's user-level systemd service
(mios-launcher.service under user@992.service), so it inherits the
operator's full WSLg env: WAYLAND_DISPLAY, WSL2_GUI_APPS_ENABLED=1,
WSL_INTEROP=/run/WSL/<pid>_interop, DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS, etc.
That env is what flatpak GUI apps + Windows .exe interop both need
to actually surface windows on the operator's desktop.

The agent (mios-hermes uid 820) cannot call wsl.exe or any other
Windows .exe directly because /mnt/c/Windows/System32/*.exe is mode
0544 owned by mios:mios with WSL metadata xattrs that even root
can't strip (Windows ACL blocks the xattr write for system files).
Workaround: agent connects to this broker's unix socket, writes a
single line of shell, broker dispatches it from operator context.

PROTOCOL
--------
Client connects to UNIX socket at /run/user/<uid>/mios-launcher.sock
(socket mode 0666 so any local user can connect).

Send: <one line of shell>

Recv: OK
   (broker has dispatched the command; not "command finished")
       ERROR: <reason>
  (request rejected before dispatch)

Connection closed after one line. Broker spawns the dispatched
command via subprocess.Popen with start_new_session=True so it
detaches from the broker -- broker can serve other requests
immediately, dispatched command runs forever (or until it exits).

Authentication is filesystem permissions on the socket: mode 0660,
group mios-ai. That is exactly the two parties involved -- this broker
runs as the operator, the agent plane runs as User=mios-ai, and `mios`
is a member of the mios-ai group (sysusers.d/10-mios.conf).

The socket was previously 0666, justified on the grounds that the agent
stack already holds NOPASSWD: ALL sudo so the broker granted nothing
new. That reasoning does not hold for the party it actually exposed.
0666 admitted EVERY local uid, not just the agent stack -- and the agent
executes model-generated code in a sandbox, so a world-writable broker
socket was an unauthenticated path out of that sandbox to arbitrary
execution as the operator. Confinement that a socket bypasses is not
confinement.

If the group cannot be applied the broker refuses to listen rather than
falling back to a wider mode; a broker that does not start is safer than
one every local user can reach.

Still open, deliberately not done here: /run/mios-launcher is 1777
(tmpfiles.d/mios-launcher.conf), and per-caller token auth under
/etc/mios/launcher-token would authenticate the CALLER rather than its
group. Both are follow-ups, not substitutes for narrowing the mode.

<!-- mios-src:10389a44c96e from usr/libexec/mios/mios-launcher-daemon:4-56 -->

### The socket was 0666

The socket was 0666: ANY local user could dispatch arbitrary commands as the
operator. The only legitimate caller is the agent plane, which runs as
User=mios-ai, while this broker runs as the operator -- so the access this
needs is exactly "these two", not "everyone". `mios` is a member of the
mios-ai group (sysusers.d/10-mios.conf: `m mios mios-ai`), so group
ownership plus 0660 grants both and no one else.

This matters beyond tidiness: the agent executes model-generated code in a
sandbox, and a world-writable broker socket is an unauthenticated path out
of that sandbox to arbitrary execution as the operator.

### mios-manual -- corpus ledger and census for the MiOS...

mios-manual -- corpus ledger and census for the MiOS documentation system.

Spec: docs/design/doc-generative-documentation.md sections 3.4 and 5.

Subcommands:
  ledger   rebuild usr/share/mios/reference/manual-corpus.tsv from the tree
  audit    census as JSON (counts by class and reason)
  coverage the two ratchet numbers, for the gate and for humans
  harvest  move a comment's prose into a doc and record where it landed
  prune    delete a comment that provably landed (the only destructive path)
  landing  verify every pruned comment still lands in a doc
  render   splice derived content into MIOS-GEN marker interiors

`--root` selects the repo, and either layout resolves, so the same tools serve
mios.git and mios-bootstrap.git without being copied across (Law 15).

The ledger is the safety mechanism for the whole programme. Deletion of a
comment is only ever permitted once a ledger row proves its knowledge reached a
doc, so the landing columns must survive ordinary code churn: they are carried
forward BY CONTENT HASH, never recomputed. Moving a block within a file, or
reformatting the code around it, keeps its landing record.

Rows for blocks that no longer exist but were pruned are kept as tombstones --
that retention is what lets a gate prove, after the fact, that a comment which
is gone did land somewhere first.

The SSOT for a repo root, in either repo's layout.

    what lets one set of doc tools serve both repos, instead of the tools being
    copied across -- which Law 15 forbids.

### sha12 -> row for lookups, every row preserved for writing....

sha12 -> row for lookups, every row preserved for writing.

    A plain dict keyed by sha12 loses duplicates, and identical comment text is
    common -- the same header boilerplate sits in many files. Reading the ledger
    into one and writing `list(rows.values())` back silently dropped 1105 of
    9669 rows, so a harvest followed by a commit would have deleted a ninth of
    the census with nothing to show for it.

<!-- mios-src:9e7f9f13eac9 from usr/libexec/mios/mios-manual:99-106 -->

### The census must be the same artifact everywhere, or it is...

The census must be the same artifact everywhere, or it is not a projection.

    A file the Python lexer could not tokenize or parse falls back to the regex
    lexer, which the module itself documents as miscounting -- and whether that
    happens depends on the INTERPRETER, not the file, so the same tree yields
    different ledgers on different machines. Refusing is the honest outcome.

True when this row's knowledge is provably in a doc.

    The predicate `prune` and the landing gate both use. Deliberately strict:
    the doc must exist, must carry the block's own content hash as an anchor,
    and the passage must retain most of the words. Anything weaker would let a
    one-line stub authorise deleting a 90-line design note.

A short human title for a harvested passage.

Clean a scraped comment before it reaches a doc.

    A comment is written for whoever is editing that file; a manual is read by

    secret that leaked into a comment must not be republished into a doc that
    ships in the image.

The Day-N+1 pass: scrape comments, sanitize, distil into the manual.

    Deliberately NON-destructive. It never edits source and never touches an

    deriver, while narrative comments are copied forward. Removing a scraped
    comment stays a separate, opt-in `prune`.

Move a source comment's PROSE into a doc, and record where it landed.

    Harvest never edits source. It writes the passage, stamps the anchor and

    the original, and only once landed() proves this step happened.

Every pruned comment must still be provably present in a doc.

Splice derived content into marker pairs. Writes NOWHERE else.

    The whole safety story of the doc model is that regeneration cannot destroy
    hand-written prose. That holds only because this function's sole write is
    replacing the interior of a matched MIOS-GEN pair -- there is deliberately no
    code path that emits a whole file, so an authored paragraph outside a marker
    is untouchable even if a deriver misbehaves.

Scope: every TRACKED Markdown file, not just usr/share/doc/mios -- a
marker in README.md or docs/ was previously never rendered or checked, so
a stale derived table could ship from there. Note this cannot reuse
mios_comments.iter_source_files: that filters by SCAN_EXT, which
deliberately excludes .md, and using it here silently emptied the scope.
Only files that actually contain a marker are opened for writing.

### mios-mcp-server -- Model Context Protocol stdio server....

mios-mcp-server -- Model Context Protocol stdio server.

Exposes MiOS's [verbs.*] catalog (SSOT in mios.toml) as MCP tools so
LOCAL MCP-aware agents can drive MiOS verbs natively.

LOCAL-ONLY by design. Intended consumers:
  * MiOS-Hermes        (local; primary tool catalog)
  * MiOS-OpenCode      (local; coding agent)
  * mios-daemon-agent  (local; background sub-agent)
  * Any LOCAL MCP client the operator stands up against on-host models

NOT for cloud-LLM clients. The operator's binding rule (2026-05-19)
is "no cloud dependencies": MCP clients that route through hosted LLM
providers (Claude Desktop, Cursor, GitHub Copilot, Codex Cloud) MUST
NOT be in the chain. They CAN consume this server, but the MiOS
operator does not run them.

Protocol: JSON-RPC 2.0 over Streamable HTTP (current transport) + stdio. The
declared revision is the [mcp].protocol_version SSOT (env
MIOS_MCP_PROTOCOL_VERSION), shared with the agent-pipe consumer.
  https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification

Implements:
  initialize          -- handshake; returns serverInfo + capabilities
  notifications/initialized  -- accepted, no response
  tools/list          -- renders [verbs.*] as MCP tool specs (calls

    are unavailable (cold start + agent-pipe down) so a client is never toolless
    for its whole life. Skills are NOT built here (they live in pgvector,
    unreachable from this sandbox); the verb+recipe surface -- every launch /
    OS-control / web tool -- is the floor that matters. Mirrors agent-pipe's
    /v1/tools projections (server.py:15461 verbs, :5345 recipes, :4760 filter).

True when `live` looks like a degrade-open partial that would POISON
    last-good if saved. Two cases: (a) empty or >50%-shrunk vs cache (warmup);
    (b) it LOST promoted skills without gaining any -- agent-pipe's /v1/tools is
    degrade-open (server.py:15583-15590): a pgvector outage silently drops the
    skills tail (HTTP 200, no error), a drop too small to trip the size guard, so
    a skill-less feed would otherwise be accepted + persisted as the new last-good.

Keep the last-good catalog warm independent of client connect timing.
    Re-tries faster while the upstream looks unhealthy so the cache re-warms
    promptly once agent-pipe recovers. When the served catalog actually CHANGES
    (e.g. recovers from the SSOT floor / a degraded set back to the full surface),
    push notifications/tools/list_changed so already-connected clients that honor
    it (Hermes) re-list mid-session instead of being stuck on the degraded set.

### mios-micro-llm -- thin client + persistent-loaded helper...

mios-micro-llm -- thin client + persistent-loaded helper for the
always-on tiny model.

Used by:
  * mios-log-watcher.service -- classifies journal events
  * mios-cron-director.service -- gates scheduled tasks on system state
  * any agent / shim that wants <500 ms classification

The "micro" model is configured via mios.toml [ai].micro_model
(default qwen3:1.7b -- the 4-model-set micro/CPU base, ~1.4 GB
resident; was qwen3:0.6b before the 2026-06-01 consolidation).
Kept warm on the mios-llm-light /v1 lane (llama-swap owns residency/TTL).

USAGE
    mios-micro-llm classify <prompt>            -> single-line answer
    mios-micro-llm classify --json <prompt>     -> JSON wrapper
    mios-micro-llm warm                         -> issue a 1-token gen to load
    mios-micro-llm status                       -> is it loaded? latency probe

CONFIG (per layered mios.toml [ai] priority):
    [ai]
    micro_model    = "qwen3:1.7b"
    micro_endpoint = "http://localhost:8450/v1"
    micro_keep_alive_seconds = -1   # -1 = never unload

### mios-model-router — always-on front door + worker fan-out...

mios-model-router — always-on front door + worker fan-out (OpenAI-compatible).

Operator 2026-06-08: "EVERYTHING starts at the front-door model and delegates to
nodes from there — multiple smaller modern models across all nodes, full tools."
The front door must prefill the ~17K-token MCP tool surface (113 tools) that Hermes
sends EVERY turn AND emit tool calls — fast. MEASURED head-to-head on that exact
17K prompt (2026-06-08):
  CPU  (qwen3-4b)        169s, answered in PROSE (no tool call)   -> non-viable
  iGPU (qwen2.5-1.5b)    >180s TIMEOUT                            -> non-viable
  dGPU (qwen3:1.7b,4090) 2.2s cold / 0.2s warm, EMITS open_app    -> the only one
The small/integrated lanes are ~100 tok/s prefill; the 4090 is ~85x faster AND
llama.cpp prefix-caches the stable tool surface (cached_tokens 15257 -> 0.2s turns).
So the dGPU(:8500) with a SMALL model (qwen3:1.7b ~2GB VRAM — does NOT fight gaming
like the 16GB heavy model did) is the front door; iGPU(:11436) + CPU(:11451) are
slow fallbacks + delegated workers.

Logical models:
  mios-orchestrator -> dGPU light node (:8500 qwen3:1.7b) PRIMARY; iGPU/CPU FALLBACK
                       (failover, preference order). The entry point / front door.
  mios-fanout       -> ROUND-ROBIN across ALL worker nodes (dGPU :8500 qwen3:1.7b,
                       iGPU :11436, CPU :11451) so concurrent delegated children land
                       on DIFFERENT hardware and run truly in parallel.
  mios-heavy        -> legacy compat (failover across workers).

Background health probe every 8s; per-lane 30s cooldown on error; SSE passthrough.
Response carries X-MiOS-Lane / X-MiOS-Model so you can SEE which node served.
Override lanes via MIOS_ROUTER_DEPLOYMENTS (JSON). Port via MIOS_ROUTER_PORT.

The sentinel is the unit's ConditionPathExists gate, so writing it
unconditionally retired the provisioner after ONE pass -- a failed download or
a rejected digest meant that model was never fetched again. Write it only when
every declared model is actually on disk; otherwise leave it and let
mios-models-firstboot.timer come back. Still exit 0 either way: degrade-open,
a pull must never block boot (Architectural Law 12).

The lowest unused ordinal in dest_dir, for a type numbered sequentially.

    Scanning beats a stored counter: the directory listing IS the allocation
    record, so it cannot drift out of step with the files the way a hand-bumped
    name_prefix in SSOT did. An unreadable or empty directory yields the first
    ordinal rather than raising -- scaffolding into a fresh tree is legitimate.

### usr/libexec/mios/mios-os-control [subcommand] [flags] The...

/usr/libexec/mios/mios-os-control [subcommand] [flags]

The unifying entrypoint for MiOS's OS-control surface: VERBS (atomic
OpenAI-callable operations), RECIPES (OS-shell templates) and SKILLS
(composed verb sequences). Everything is sourced from SSOT -- mios.toml
[verbs.*] / [recipes.*] and /usr/share/mios/skills/*.json -- so there
are ZERO hardcoded operation lists anywhere: add a verb in TOML and it
appears here (and in every consumer) automatically. Self-iterating.

Operator binding 2026-05-20: "mios-os-control is an entire OS-related
recipes, tools and skills that are ALL Day-0 ready and self iterating --
Absolutely NO hardcodes for anything variable ... OpenAI compliant for
all llms/models use GLOBALLY ... has defaults for window launching
positions". This tool is that single source: any LLM/model -- not just
OWUI -- consumes `mios-os-control schema` to learn the full tool surface.

Subcommands:
  schema [--openai|--owui|--names] [--tier core|common|rare|all]
                       Emit the tool schema for every verb, generated
                       from mios.toml [verbs.*].
                         --openai (default) -> OpenAI tools array:
                              [{type:function, function:{name,
                               description, parameters}}]
                         --owui   -> Open WebUI specs list:
                              [{name, description, parameters}]
                         --names  -> bare verb names, one per line
                       --tier filters by verb tier (default: all).
  verbs [--tier ...]   Human-readable verb catalog (name / sig / desc).
  recipes              Delegate to `mios-os-recipe list`.
  skills               List composed skills in /usr/share/mios/skills.
  window-defaults      Emit the [os_control] window-placement defaults
                       (JSON) -- the SSOT for where launches land.
  doctor               Self-check: verify every verb has a description +
                       valid params block + every enum default is in its
                       enum; report drift. Exit non-zero on any problem.

SSOT: mios.toml is the only source of verbs/recipes; skills/*.json the
only source of skills. No code change needed to add capabilities.

DELEGATE a launch to the always-on mios-daemon-agent (the iGPU
    daemon-tier brain): it FIRES the launch THROUGH THE BROKER (the only
    context with the WSLg display env to surface a window) AND runs the
    success-check, returning ONE verdict. The agent reads `launched` instead
    of firing + checking itself (operator 2026-05-25, 4A #2). The daemon is
    the SOLE firer; if it's unreachable this fires NOTHING and returns an
    honest error so the agent falls back to plain open_app + verify_launch.
    Offline-first; NEVER fabricates launched=true.

    Usage: mios-os-control launch "<app name>" [--timeout SECONDS]
    Output JSON: {success, app, fired, launched, verdict, attempts, checked_by}.

### usr/libexec/mios/mios-os-recipe <name> [key=value ...]...

/usr/libexec/mios/mios-os-recipe <name> [key=value ...]

Executes a NAMED, ALLOWLISTED os-shell recipe declared in mios.toml
under [recipes.<name>]. Picks the OS-appropriate template (linux /
windows), shell-escapes every parameter, optionally converts Linux
paths to Windows paths via wslpath, and dispatches.

Hardening:
  * Only recipes present in mios.toml [recipes.*] are executable --
    arbitrary command pass-through is impossible.
  * Only kwargs whose key appears in the recipe's `args` list survive
    to the template; everything else is dropped.
  * `permission = "write"` recipes require MIOS_OS_RECIPE_WRITE=1
    in env (set by the operator via mios.toml -> userenv.sh slot).
  * Every {placeholder} substitution is shell-quoted before splice
    -- shlex.quote on Linux, double-quote-escape on Windows.
  * `wsl_paths` arg names get wslpath -w conversion when the windows
    template is chosen so File Explorer / Notepad receive a native
    Windows path.

Output: --json prints {success, exit_code, stdout, stderr, template,
target_os}; default mode prints stdout/stderr directly + exits with
the recipe's exit code.

SSOT: mios.toml is the only source of recipes. Add new recipes in
TOML; no code change required.

### mios-oscap-gate -- severity-gated verdict over an OpenSCAP...

mios-oscap-gate -- severity-gated verdict over an OpenSCAP results (ARF/XCCDF) file.

Usage: mios-oscap-gate <results.(arf|xml)> [severity_gate]
  severity_gate: high | medium | low | any   (default: high)

oscap's own exit codes only tell you "some rule failed" (rc=2), not WHICH severity.
The scan-only gate (86-oscap-compliance.sh) calls this to turn the results into a
build verdict: it counts FAILED rules at/above the configured severity and fails the
build iff that count is > 0. Severity ordering is structural (high>medium>low); a
failed rule with no/unknown severity counts only under the "any" gate.

### mios-owui-apply-knowledge -- attach a MiOS-Documentation...

mios-owui-apply-knowledge -- attach a MiOS-Documentation Knowledge
collection to the MiOS-Agent model row in Open WebUI, sourced
DIRECTLY from the FHS.

Operator directive 2026-05-15: "use the files directly from the FHS--
and refine the files themselves". The files in /usr/share/mios/ai/,
/usr/share/mios/docs/, /usr/share/mios/hermes/skills/,
/usr/share/mios/cookbooks/, /usr/share/mios/prompts/,
/etc/mios/system-prompts/, /CLAUDE.md, and /AGENTS.md ARE the
authoritative MiOS knowledge corpus. This helper registers each one
as an OWUI `file` row with `path = <absolute FHS path>` and links
them into a Knowledge row that the MiOS-Agent model row's
`meta.knowledge` references.

Why both `path` AND `data.content`?

  * `file.path` -- so OWUI's `/files/` re-process pipeline reads from
    the canonical FHS source when re-vectoring (requires the OWUI
    container to have /usr/share/mios + /etc/mios bind-mounted; see
    /etc/containers/systemd/mios-open-webui.container).
  * `file.data['content']` -- the snapshot OWUI uses inside the
    `/knowledge/{id}/file/add` flow when re-using cached chunks isn't
    possible (e.g. first index, hash drift). Stays accurate because
    we re-read at apply time and refresh on hash drift.
  * `file.hash` -- sha256 of the source content. If the on-disk file
    changes, the hash drifts, we clear OWUI's per-file vector
    collection (`file-{id}`), and OWUI re-indexes from the now-fresh
    `file.data.content`/`file.path` at next attach.

Idempotent. Runs on host (not inside container) -- writes directly to
the sqlite db at /var/lib/mios/open-webui/webui.db.

Designed to be safe to run from a Quadlet ExecStartPost, a oneshot
service, or the operator's shell. Returns 0 on success/no-op.

<!-- mios-src:1bea96de2326 from usr/libexec/mios/mios-owui-apply-knowledge:4-38 -->

### Best-effort

Best-effort: vector_db is on a bind-mount the host can see at
    /var/lib/mios/open-webui/vector_db.  ChromaDB stores collections
    under that directory; clearing them is enough to force a re-index
    on next read.  This is a soft cleanup -- if the directory layout
    changes upstream, OWUI will just re-vector when it can't find the
    collection and we'll have wasted no operator-visible work.

mios-owui-apply-suggestions -- HANDS-OFF mode.

Operator directive 2026-05-17: "no hardcoded answers or anything
hardcoded for english at all--Completely generic and platform
agnostic--GLOBALLY FOR ALL FILES; AUDIT".

Previous incarnations of this script seeded a 40-entry English-only
pool of MiOS-flavored prompt cards. That violated the rule above.

The correct architecture: OWUI's built-in
`ENABLE_SUGGESTION_GENERATION=True` (set in the Quadlet) asks the
task model (TASK_MODEL_EXTERNAL=hermes-agent) to PRODUCE suggestions
per session, in the operator's language, aware of recent context.
The model picks the locale + the content from the running chat;
nothing is hardcoded here.

This script now ONLY WIPES any leftover hardcoded suggestions from
prior runs so OWUI falls back to its LLM-generated path. Re-running
is idempotent.

Operators who want a fixed set (no LLM call per session) can populate
ui.prompt_suggestions in OWUI's admin UI by hand -- that's their
choice, not vendor default.

### mios-owui-apply-system-prompt -- seed the MiOS-Agent model...

mios-owui-apply-system-prompt -- seed the MiOS-Agent model registration in
Open WebUI with the MiOS-managed system prompt.

OWUI stores per-model overrides in its sqlite db at
/var/lib/mios/open-webui/webui.db, table `model`, column `params` (JSON).
The `params.system` field is what OWUI prepends to the user's first
message in every chat that selects this model -- it rides on top of
Hermes's SOUL.md (the agent's own persona) as belt-and-suspenders
reinforcement. See /usr/share/mios/open-webui/system-prompts/mios-agent.md
for the rationale.

Idempotent. Re-seed conditions (mirror SOUL.md re-seed logic):
  * model row absent: skip with a clear log line
  * params.system absent OR contains "MiOS-managed" marker AND content
    differs from source: write source content
  * params.system has been edited away from the marker: leave alone
    (operator has taken ownership)

Designed to be safe to run from a Quadlet ExecStartPost, a oneshot
service, or the operator's shell. Returns 0 on success/no-op.

mios-owui-apply-websearch -- enable Open WebUI's built-in web-search
augmentation + point it at the local SearXNG (mios-searxng container
on :8800).

OWUI's web-search feature is OFF by default in upstream. When enabled,
every chat turn can be augmented by retrieving + injecting web results
into the model's context (gated by an in-chat toggle the user clicks
on each message). Pointing it at the local SearXNG keeps everything
on-box; no external API keys, no rate limits, no telemetry.

Idempotent: only updates keys that aren't already correct. Mirrors the
mios-owui-apply-system-prompt pattern (operator-managed marker via the
default values themselves -- if the operator changes a key in OWUI's
admin UI, this script LEAVES it alone unless that key is one of the
must-be-true bools we flip).

mios-owui-bootstrap-admin -- create the first OWUI admin user when
the `user` table is empty, so a fresh install / reinstall doesn't

Resolves identity from layered mios.toml ([identity].username,
[identity].email) and the password from the MiOS password SSOT (see
_read_password): MIOS_OPERATOR_PASSWORD / MIOS_OWUI_ADMIN_PASSWORD ->
mios.toml [identity].default_password -> MIOS_DEFAULT_PASSWORD -> "mios"
-- the SAME source Forge / Portal / Cockpit / RDP use, so one operator
password works everywhere. A "__random__" override generates + writes a
24-char password to /etc/mios/owui-admin-password (mode 0600 root-only).

Idempotent: skips if any user row exists. Logs to stderr so
mios-hermes-firstboot can capture the output via _log.

Why direct sqlite + bcrypt instead of POST /api/v1/auths/signup:
  * doesn't depend on OWUI being up + responsive at firstboot time
  * doesn't need ENABLE_SIGNUP=True dance (toggle env, restart, post,
    toggle back, restart) which is fragile and slow
  * uses the same bcrypt scheme OWUI does (passlib bcrypt $2b$)

Returns exit 0 on success, no-op skip, or any expected non-fatal path.
Returns exit 2 only on hard infrastructure failures (db missing, no
admin name resolvable). Designed to never block firstboot.

      2. MIOS_OWUI_ADMIN_PASSWORD   -- per-service override (parallels
                                       MIOS_FORGE_ADMIN_PASSWORD)
      3. mios.toml [identity].default_password  -- the canonical SSOT field
      4. MIOS_DEFAULT_PASSWORD (install.env)    -- shell/systemd bridge of #3
      5. literal "mios"             -- vendor default; the same final fallback
                                       as usr/libexec/mios/forge-firstboot.sh

    A value of "__random__" at any tier opts INTO a generated 24-char password
    (written to PASSWORD_OUT, mode 0600), mirroring forge's __random__ token.
    We deliberately do NOT silently generate a random password: an operator
    who never sees it can't log in, and it diverges from the rest of the OS.

mios-owui-install-computer-use -- idempotent registration of the MiOS
Computer-Use OWUI Native tool (WS-4 P0) into webui.db's `tool` table, so the
chat model gets the desktop control + vision grounding + doc-gen verbs as typed
tool_calls instead of indirecting through the generic `terminal:` shell tool.

Mirrors mios-owui-install-tools exactly (same DB shape, change-detection over
content+specs, admin attribution, model auto-attach). Source module:
  /usr/share/mios/openwebui/tools/mios_computer_use.py

The `specs` list MUST stay in lockstep with the Tools class methods in that
module AND every spec MUST carry a JSONSchema `parameters` block -- OWUI's
process_chat indexes spec["parameters"] and a partial spec crashes the whole
chat with KeyError: 'parameters' (operator-flagged regression on the verbs
tool, 2026-05-17).

Intended to run from mios-hermes-firstboot.service alongside the existing
install-pipe / install-tools helpers. Default-OFF posture: the tool's own
Valves ship WRITE_ACTIONS_ENABLED=False and mios-docgen is gated server-side,
so registering it is inert until the operator opts into desktop writes.

(agent-pipe, MiOS-Hermes, MiOS-OpenCode, mios-daemon, cron-
director, future MCP clients) gets an Ed25519 keypair under
/var/lib/mios/agent-passports/<agent>/{private.key,public.key}.

Security-relevant agent-DB writes (tool_call, skill_invocation,
firewall_block events) carry a passport envelope of the shape:

  {agent, ts, nonce, op_hash, alg, kid, sig}

where op_hash binds the signature to the canonical-JSON of the
record's other fields. Any verifier with read access to the
agent's public key (which is world-readable) can validate the
envelope without contacting an external KMS, online CA, or other
agent.

Subcommands:

  provision [--agent NAME] [--force]
                       Generate an Ed25519 keypair for an agent.
                       Defaults to every agent in
                       [passport].agents. Writes
                       <key_dir>/<agent>/private.key (0600 owner
                       sysuser) + public.key (0644 world-readable)
                       + registers the public key in the agent DB
                       (agent_keypair table). Idempotent unless
                       --force (which rotates).

  list                 Print the registered keypairs (agent / kid
                       / provisioned_at / retired).

  show <agent>         Print the agent's current public key + kid.

  sign --agent NAME --payload @file
                       Read a JSON payload from --payload (or '-'
                       for stdin), sign it as <agent>, print the
                       envelope as JSON. Operator-callable
                       primitive for non-Python integrations.

  verify --envelope @file [--payload @file]
                       Parse a passport envelope. Resolve the
                       public key for envelope.agent (filesystem
                       first; falls back to the agent-DB agent_keypair
                       row). Verify the Ed25519 signature. Exits
                       0 on valid + 2 on invalid + 3 on missing
                       key.

  rotate <agent>       Mark the current key retired, generate a
                       new one (kid increments). Old kid stays in
                       agent_keypair for verifying historical
                       writes.

  hash --table T --payload @file
                       Print sha256(table:canonical-json) of the
                       payload as the op_hash used inside passport
                       envelopes. Same algorithm agent-pipe uses
                       so external integrators can pre-compute.

  public-key <agent>   Print the raw PEM-encoded public key. Use
                       this to ship a key to an external verifier
                       without parsing the agent DB.

Fully local + offline. Uses python3-cryptography (in the Fedora
base image) -- NOT a pip install.

SSOT: every knob (enable, algo, key_dir, rotate_days,
verify_on_read, agents) routes through MIOS_PASSPORT_* env
which userenv.sh sources from mios.toml [passport].

The canonical payload-to-sign. Newline-separated 4-tuple --
    deterministic + simple to re-derive from external languages.

    NOTE: any change here breaks every existing passport's
    signature. Add new fields by extending the envelope + bumping
    a `v` field, NOT by mutating this signing payload.

### Verify a passport envelope. Returns (ok, reason). If...

Verify a passport envelope. Returns (ok, reason).

    If `payload_for_hash` is supplied as (table, fields), the
    function additionally re-computes the op_hash and compares it
    to the envelope -- the strongest check (signature + data
    integrity). Without payload_for_hash, only the signature is
    verified (still proves attribution but doesn't bind to data).

### Exit reflecting the executor's READ-BACK verdict, not just...

Exit reflecting the executor's READ-BACK verdict, not just transport success.
    The Windows OS-control executor returns {ok,verified,reason} (Invoke-TypeText et
    al.): a type/click/window op that did NOT land returns verified:false / ok:false
    in the BODY.

    FAIL CLOSED (operator 2026-06-19/20: "type reported SUCCESS but nothing was
    typed" -- twice). The prior version exited 0 on an unparseable/empty/non-dict/
    keyless body to "not false-fail a transport quirk" -- but THAT is the lie: when
    the verdict cannot be determined the op's success is UNKNOWN, and an unknown is
    NOT a success. A false FAILURE is recoverable (the caller retries / sees real
    state); a false SUCCESS is the fabrication the operator keeps catching. So we
    exit 0 ONLY on an EXPLICIT truthy verdict key; every undeterminable case exits 1
    with a diagnostic. (Launch is ALSO independently re-verified by the window-diff
    in server.py, so failing this closed never silently drops a real launch.)

mios-pc-vision -- screenshot + UI-element query -> click coordinates.

Local-only PC-Control vision grounding. Takes a screenshot path + a
natural-language description of a UI target, calls a local vision
LLM (default qwen3-vl:4b on mios-llm-light :8450), returns JSON:

### mios-pg-query -- minimal pure-stdlib PostgreSQL client for...

mios-pg-query -- minimal pure-stdlib PostgreSQL client for the MiOS agent
plane. No psql binary, no psycopg, no podman needed: it speaks the v3 wire
protocol directly over a loopback TCP socket.

Why this exists (R15): confined service users such as `mios-ai` (which runs
mios-daemon's directory indexer + the dispatched directory_lookup verb) have
NEITHER a psql binary NOR podman access to exec into the pgvector container --
so `mios-db --pg`'s two existing paths both fail for them, and the agent plane
could not reach pgvector. This is the universal fallback. It relies on the
pgvector pg_hba `host all all 127.0.0.1/32 trust` line (loopback trust), so
there is no auth exchange -- the StartupMessage is answered with
AuthenticationOk directly.

Two modes:
  1. SIMPLE (default, unchanged):  mios-pg-query [-At ...] '<sql>'   (or SQL on
     stdin). Sends the SQL verbatim as one simple-Query ('Q') message. Multiple
     / multi-statement queries are handled. The SQL is run AS-IS -- the caller
     owns its safety (it is a trusted raw-SQL transport / console).
  2. EXTENDED / parameterized (WS-A3):  mios-pg-query --exec-json   reads a JSON
     envelope on stdin and binds the values OUT-OF-BAND via the v3 extended
     query protocol (Parse/Bind/Execute/Sync), so NO value is ever spliced into
     the SQL text (kills SQL-injection). Two envelope shapes:
        {"sql": "... $1 ... $2 ...", "params": [v1, v2, ...]}
        {"statements": [{"sql": "...", "params": [...]}, ...]}  # one txn (atomic)
     Placeholders are $1..$n; params are bound as TEXT format with unspecified
     type (the backend infers from context / an explicit ::cast in the SQL).
     NULL is JSON null; keep integers (e.g. LIMIT) inline in the SQL string
     (int-coerced by the caller) to avoid text->int inference edge cases.

Env:    MIOS_PG_HOST (127.0.0.1) MIOS_PG_PORT (5432)
        MIOS_PG_USER (mios)      MIOS_PG_DB (mios)
        T-068 RLS: MIOS_DB_RLS_ENABLE (off) gates a per-connection owner scope;
        the owner comes from `--owner <v>` (or `--owner=<v>`) else MIOS_PG_RLS_OWNER.
        When enabled+owner, an owner-bound `set_config('mios.owner_user', ...)` is
        SET first so the schema RLS policies scope rows to that owner. Default-off /
        no owner -> nothing is emitted (byte-identical; no consumer is locked out).
Output: tab-separated columns, one row per line (psql -At shape) for BOTH modes.
        Multi-row handled; NULLs render as empty. Exit 1 on any backend
        ErrorResponse or unsupported (non-trust) auth.

### The owner to scope THIS invocation's rows to, or None to...

The owner to scope THIS invocation's rows to, or None to emit NO scope.
    Gated by MIOS_DB_RLS_ENABLE (SSOT [pgvector].rls_enable, bridged by userenv.sh),
    the SAME flag the agent-pipe pg path reads -- default-off => None => no change.
    The owner comes from `--owner <v>` (or `--owner=<v>`) else MIOS_PG_RLS_OWNER, so
    the confined consumers (mios-ai / daemon / skills / kg) can scope their reads.
    None whenever RLS is off OR no owner is supplied -> the GUC stays unset -> the
    schema policy is permissive (degrade-open: a confined tool / the daemon is NEVER
    locked out).

### Bind this connection's RLS owner GUC. The owner + the GUC...

Bind this connection's RLS owner GUC. The owner + the GUC name are BOUND via
    the extended protocol ($1/$2 -> Parse/Bind/Execute/Sync) -- NEVER spliced into
    SQL. The CLI uses ONE connection per process invocation (no pooling), so the GUC
    is set SESSION-level (set_config(..., false)) once right after connect and
    naturally spans every following statement of this invocation -- simple OR
    extended -- then dies with the process. (The agent-pipe python path uses
    is_local=true / transaction-local instead, because its connections may be
    reused.) No-op when owner is None (RLS off / no owner) -> byte-identical to
    today. Best-effort: a failed set is noted on stderr but does not abort
    (degrade-open; the schema policy is permissive on an unset GUC).

### `& <script>` keeps the callee a real script: its own line...

`& <script>` keeps the callee a real script: its own line numbers survive in
error records, and its `exit N` returns here through $LASTEXITCODE instead of
killing the runspace with the format buffer still unflushed.

### mios-rag -- agent-pipe RAG over MiOS knowledge, on infra...

mios-rag -- agent-pipe RAG over MiOS knowledge, on infra MiOS already runs:
nomic-embed-text for embeddings + Postgres+pgvector for the vector store. Keeps
RAG in-loop for every agent/sub-agent turn WITHOUT OWUI's blocking pre-pipe
knowledge_search (operator 2026-05-20: "move RAG into the agent-pipe enrich
stage").

Subcommands:
  ingest [--dir D ...]   Chunk + embed the MiOS docs (and any extra dirs) into
                         the pgvector table `mios_rag`. Idempotent: clears +
                         rebuilds. Run on docs change.
  query  <text> [--k N]  Embed the text, vector-search the store, print the
                         top-N {source, text, score} as JSON.

WS-A3 cutover: the legacy DB (:8000) is RETIRED. The vector store is Postgres+
pgvector reached via the pure-python mios-pg-query wire client, and the ingest
INSERT binds source/content/emb as OUT-OF-BAND params (mios-pg-query --exec-json
extended protocol) -- no filesystem-sourced value is ever spliced into SQL.

Config (SSOT-overridable via env):
  MIOS_RAG_EMBED_ENDPOINT  default http://localhost:8450 (mios-llm-light /v1)
  MIOS_RAG_EMBED_MODEL     default nomic-embed-text
  MIOS_RAG_DOCS_DIR        default /usr/share/mios/docs

### mios-remember -- agent-authored durable memory...

mios-remember -- agent-authored durable memory (Letta/MemGPT core tier).

P4.2 (Letta/MemGPT active virtual memory): MiOS already has the PASSIVE tiers
-- per-conversation scratchpad (working), the knowledge table (auto-stored Q+A,
recall), and episodic SKILL.md + viking:// (archival). What was missing is the
ACTIVE / SELF-EDITING tier: the agent (or operator) deliberately WRITING a
durable fact it wants to keep -- Letta's core_memory_append. This shim is that
write half.

DESIGN respects the MiOS "NO context injection" rule ([[CLAUDE.md]]): memory is
TOOL-DRIVEN both ways -- the agent WRITES with this verb and READS with `recall`
(or viking_ls memory). Nothing is auto-prepended to prompts; the model learns
its memory by CALLING tools, not via a pre_llm_call inject.

Stored in Postgres+pgvector `agent_memory`, scope-tagged:
  global         -- durable facts true across all conversations
  agent:<name>   -- specific to one agent
  conversation:<id> -- scoped to one chat thread

WS-A3 cutover: the legacy DB (:8000) is RETIRED. The datastore is Postgres+pgvector,
and EVERY statement is parameterized -- values are bound out-of-band via
`mios-db --pg-json` (-> mios-pg-query extended protocol), never spliced into the
SQL string. The pg column is `mem_key` (this tool's `key`).

USAGE
  mios-remember add "<fact>" [--scope global] [--key <k>] [--source <s>]
  mios-remember list [--scope global] [--limit 30]
  mios-remember forget --key <k>          # delete by key
  mios-remember update --key <k> "<new>"  # core_memory_replace

Output JSON: {ok, ...}.

<!-- mios-src:b8fc21306475 from usr/libexec/mios/mios-remember:5-36 -->

### Run a parameterized statement / atomic batch via `mios-db...

Run a parameterized statement / atomic batch via `mios-db --pg-json`,
    which binds the values OUT-OF-BAND through mios-pg-query's extended protocol
    (no value is ever spliced into the SQL text -> SQL-injection-safe). Returns
    (ok, stdout). Degrade-open: any error -> (False, '') so a DB hiccup never
    breaks a turn.

### The ref set IS the SSOT's [image.sidecars] table, read...

The ref set IS the SSOT's [image.sidecars] table, read through the sanctioned
layered resolver -- not a mirror of it. A mirror silently drifts, and every
drifted ref feeds an image MiOS does not ship into the provenance record.
localhost/ refs are skipped: they are built in-image, so no registry can
resolve them (the same constraint mios.toml documents for firstboot_tokens).

### 'MiOS' scheduled-research runner -- the `do` target for...

'MiOS' scheduled-research runner -- the `do` target for schedule rules.

Reads the rule's stored prompt, runs it through the FULL agent-pipe (refine ->
swarm/council research), and posts the result to Discord via mios-discord-send.
This is what makes "do deep research on X every 30 minutes" actually deliver:
the cron-director fires `mios-scheduled-research --rule <name>` each interval.

Honest output: JSON describing what happened (researched + posted / why not) --
never a fabricated success.

### mios-skills -- Sequential Pattern Mining + cross-agent...

mios-skills -- Sequential Pattern Mining + cross-agent skill catalog CLI.

Phase C.2 of the AgentOS roadmap. Mines the Postgres `tool_call`
table for repeating verb sequences and codifies them as `skill`
rows that EVERY agent in the MiOS stack reads from a single source:

  * mios-agent-pipe (:8700) -- reads via /skills/* REST endpoints
                               AND directly from Postgres.
  * MiOS-Hermes (:8720)     -- pulls /skills/openai-tools at startup
                               so Hermes' OpenAI-compat tool surface
                               advertises promoted skills as callable
                               tools (no Hermes-side hardcoding).
  * MiOS-OpenCode           -- same /skills/openai-tools dump (or
                               direct Postgres read for offline-only
                               OpenCode runs that can't reach
                               agent-pipe).

Skills are typed-verb DAGs -- no English narrative, no per-agent
behaviour, fully parameterized. A skill body looks like:

    {"steps": [
       {"verb": "open_app",     "args": {"name": "$app"}},
       {"verb": "focus_window", "args": {"title": "$app"}},
       {"verb": "pc_type",      "args": {"text": "$body"}},
       {"verb": "pc_key",       "args": {"key": "ctrl+s"}}
     ],
     "params": ["app", "body"]}

That body is the same shape the Phase A.1 planner emits as a DAG --
so a skill is "a DAG the operator has decided to keep". The
parameters are substituted via simple $name token replacement at
run time.

Subcommands:

  mine [--window <hours>] [--min-support <N>] [--min-length <N>]
                            Run the SPM miner against tool_call
                            history. Emits skill rows with
                            source=mined, status=candidate. Prints
                            a per-candidate summary.

  list  [--status candidate|promoted|retired|all]
        [--source mined|operator|import|all]
                            List skill rows.

  show <name>               Print skill body JSON.

  run  <name> [--param key=value ...] [--session <session-id>]
                            Execute a skill against agent-pipe's
                            /skills/run endpoint (so the dispatch
                            goes through the same firewall + taint
                            + audit chain every verb does). Prints
                            per-step result.

  promote <name>            Mark a skill as runnable (status=promoted).
  retire  <name>            Hide a skill (status=retired).
  delete  <name>            Hard-remove the row (auditable rare).

  import [--source <dir>]   Load JSON skill templates from the seed
                            catalog directory (or operator-supplied
                            dir / stdin '-'). Same template shape
                            as a mined skill body; status=operator,
                            source=import.

  export [--name <name>]    Dump skills as NDJSON to stdout. With
                            no --name, dumps everything; with
                            --name, dumps a single skill.

  openai-tools              Print the OpenAI tool-schema dump for
                            all promoted skills (the same JSON
                            /skills/openai-tools serves). Use this
                            to wire Hermes / OpenCode to the
                            catalog from offline scripts.

Fully local: stdlib only (urllib + json + argparse + re + os +
sys + subprocess). Reads/writes Postgres/pgvector via the shared
`mios-db --pg-json` CLI (parameterized $1..$n placeholders bound
out-of-band over the pg v3 extended protocol -- no hand-rolled SQL
escaping, no request data ever spliced into SQL text), and hits
agent-pipe at MIOS_AGENT_PIPE_ENDPOINT for skill runs (so the
firewall / taint chain stays uniform).

SSOT: every knob (min_length, min_support, window_hours,
auto_promote_threshold, ...) reads from MIOS_SKILLS_* env, which
the userenv.sh slot map sources from mios.toml [skills].

### Read rows from pgvector as list[dict] via parameterized...

Read rows from pgvector as list[dict] via parameterized mios-db --pg-json.

    `sql_inner` is the inner SELECT (with $1..$n placeholders); it is wrapped in
    json_agg INSIDE the envelope so the values bind out-of-band. Degrade-open ->

### Normalize verb args to a shape signature -- keys + arg...

Normalize verb args to a shape signature -- keys + arg types
    matter for grouping, but specific values become $-tokens so the
    mined skill becomes a template the operator can re-use across
    targets. Returns the deduplicated shape dict + a value map for
    later parameterization.

### Pull recent successful tool_call rows for mining...

Pull recent successful tool_call rows for mining (Postgres).

    The legacy duration form (`time::now() - {h}h`) silently matched NOTHING
    on pg, so the miner used to see "no tool_call rows" and the training loop
    starved (operator 2026-06-10 "train MiOS AI"). The old emitted-edge
    exclusion was a legacy graph traversal with no pg analogue -- re-mined
    patterns dedup by name at insert time instead. hours/limit are int()-coerced
    and stay inline (integers don't bind reliably). Degrade-open -> [].

Recent success rate of a skill (looked up by name) from the
    skill_invocation.success field. Returns (rate, samples).

    Degrade-open: (1.0, 0) on ANY error / DB miss / no invocation history ->
    NEVER blocks a skill that simply has no recorded runs yet (incl. a
    brand-new mined skill that doesn't exist in the DB at decision time).

    We first resolve the skill's record id by name, then filter
    skill_invocation rows by that ref within WINDOW_HOURS. The skill id is a
    DB-row value, so it binds out-of-band ($1) like every other external value.
    success may be NULL on still-open rows -> we drop None and only score
    closed invocations. Degrade-open -> (1.0, 0).

A single replay PASSES iff the skill run SUCCEEDED and neither the Semantic

    captures a FATAL block (a blocked step fails the run); the per-step block flags
    additionally catch a NON-fatal block in a try-each skill that recovered on a
    later step -- a firewall/HITL trip is a reliability red flag even when the skill
    still produced an answer. Reads ONLY structured result fields (no text/keyword
    matching): success + the dispatch-emitted firewall_blocked/hitl_blocked markers.

    PASSES iff EVERY one of the k replays passes _passk_run_ok -- ONE failure vetoes
    (pass^k: ALL k repeats must succeed). Fail-closed: a replay that raises counts
    as a failed replay. All k are attempted so the message can report the true

mios-suggestion-refresh -- generate MiOS-aware starter chips +
write them into OWUI's ui.prompt_suggestions.

OPERATOR DIRECTIVE
  "I WANT MIOS STARTER QUERIES THAT REVOLVE/EVOLVE/ITERATE"

OWUI's built-in ENABLE_SUGGESTION_GENERATION path produces generic
chatbot prompts (and on this stack it wasn't producing them at all).
This shim takes over: gathers MiOS state (system snapshot, recent
kanban, daemon nudges, recent refine intents) and calls the small
refine model with a tight prompt asking for 5 starter chips. The
chips:

  - Reflect what the operator just did / has queued
  - Surface unfinished work (recent unsatisfied verdicts)
  - Rotate over time as the source signals change
  - Are localised by the model based on the input context
    (no hardcoded English here)

RUN AT
  Periodic (every N min, default 10) via mios-daemon's loop, OR
  manually after a state change. Idempotent: writes the new chip
  list verbatim, no diff merge.

OUTPUT
  Updates webui.db's config row -> data.ui.prompt_suggestions
  with the new chip array. Stdout = JSON envelope with the
  chips + the metadata used to generate them (for debug).

EXIT CODES
  0  refreshed
  1  refine model unavailable / OWUI DB missing / parse fail
  2  bad arguments

Cheap snapshot of the running stack. Pulls from the daemon's
    last state.json (fresh as of its last loop tick).

    Excludes `classify` deliberately -- the daemon's journal-tail
    classifier picks up ANY recent error chatter (curl probes, dev
    activity, transient HTTP 4xx) and the suggestion model latches
    onto those, producing debug-flavored chips that don't match the
    operator's actual daily-use needs. Keep launch_failures (real
    operator-visible failures) + satisfaction (real verdicts).

    catalog rather than a hardcoded English list (operator directive:
    no hardcoded English; vast functionality coverage). Returns short

    starter chips. Falls back to concrete baseline seeds if the catalog

### Push the chip list through OWUI's POST /api/v1/configs/...

Push the chip list through OWUI's POST /api/v1/configs/
    suggestions endpoint. The API path is load-bearing -- writing
    DIRECTLY to webui.db sets the value but OWUI's runtime cache
    doesn't see it until the next service restart, so new chats
    keep showing the cached (often empty) chip row. The API
    handler updates both the persistence layer + the in-memory
    config so a chat opened ~5s later sees the fresh chips.
    Each chip is wrapped per OWUI's schema:
      {title: [primary, secondary], content: <text-sent-on-click>}
    We use the chip text for both title[0] and content so a click
    sends the literal phrase into the input.

### mios-summarize -- tiered summarisation (the L0/L1/L2 gating...

mios-summarize -- tiered summarisation (the L0/L1/L2 gating primitive).

P5.3 (Hermes v2026.5.28 / OpenViking brief): the ingestion + context-gating
layers need a CHEAP local model that turns a document into nested tiers:

  L0 -- ~100-token ABSTRACT (one-sentence semantic summary; fast nav / cheap
        similarity / directory listing).
  L1 -- ~2000-token OVERVIEW (sections, layout, key points, usage).
  L2 -- the RAW original (returned only on strict demand; here just the
        verbatim text, optionally truncated).

Runs on the CPU light lane (MIOS_SUMMARIZE_ENDPOINT, default the mios-llm-light
:8450 /v1 lane) with a small model (MIOS_SUMMARIZE_MODEL) so it never contends
with the dGPU primary -- exactly the "summarisation VLM for ingestion-side
parsing" the brief calls for. Offline-first: local llama.cpp only, no cloud.

INPUT (one of):
  --text "<inline text>"
  --file <path>            # read a UTF-8 text/markdown file
  (stdin)                  # piped text when neither flag given

[bootstrap].bootstrap_repo, NOT the first textual match: [urls] declares a
key of the same name holding the clone URL, and it appears earlier in the

the projection reported "bootstrap repo not found" and skipped -- which is
why the two repositories drifted while a sync tool appeared to run.

(start, end) index pair for [section]'s OWNED block: the '[section]' header line through

    The end is the next '[' header (top-level OR sub-table) MINUS the trailing run of comment /
    blank lines immediately above it -- because in this codebase every section is introduced by a
    comment header ABOVE it, so that trailing run belongs to the NEXT section, not this one.
    Including it was the bug that injected the [image.sidecars] header above [ports.lan_firewall]
    and deleted the lan_firewall comments. For [ports] the span stops at [ports.lan_firewall];
    the derived copies' lan_firewall sub-table + its comment header are left untouched.

/usr/libexec/mios/mios-sys-env <refresh|get|help> [--json]

Live system/environment probe persisted to pgvector so EVERY agent reads a
fast, always-current snapshot from the shared DB -- the same cache pattern
mios-daemon uses for directory_entry.

Operator 2026-05-23: "mios-os-control should fetch live system apps from a
tool/skill for probing systems/environment live and storing+updating a
mios-sys-env database; ALL agents share global read+write access (via verbs)".

What it stores (single row `sys_env:current`, in sys_env table):
  env   -- the full `mios-env-probe --json` envelope (identity, host HW, stack
           services up/down, loaded models, launchable-app counts).
  apps  -- live launchable inventory, names per category (mios-apps --names
           --category <cat>), capped -- "the live system apps".
  indexed_at / host / source -- provenance.

Subcommands:
  refresh [--json]   WRITE: probe live + upsert sys_env:current. Any agent can
                     call this to UPDATE the shared env DB (sys_env_refresh verb).
  get [--json] [--full]
                     READ: return sys_env:current. COMPACT by default (env +
                     per-category app counts + a small sample) so it stays
                     parseable under the broker's ~6 KB stdout cap; --full emits
                     the complete inventory (CLI/dashboard). If the row is
                     missing, falls back to a live (non-persisted) probe so the
                     read is always useful (sys_env verb).

### mios-system-status -- emit a single JSON blob with the live...

mios-system-status -- emit a single JSON blob with the live MiOS
host dashboard data the chat model needs to answer "system status?"
questions WITHOUT fabricating fields.

Backs the `system_status` native MiOS Verb. The model calls one
tool, gets one structured object, and reports verbatim -- no more
"No NVIDIA driver detected" hallucinations from a model assembling
the dashboard out of 4 separate shell-tool outputs.

All probes are best-effort. A missing field comes back as null
(NOT a fabricated default), so the model can correctly say
"GPU info unavailable" instead of inventing one.

Fields:
  cpu         {model, cores, load_1m, load_5m, load_15m, load_pct_of_cores}
  gpu         list of {name, vram_mib, driver}   (nvidia-smi / rocm-smi)
  memory      {total_mib, used_mib, available_mib, swap_total_mib}
  disk        list of {mount, total, used, available, pct}
  services    {failed: [...], active_count, mios: {<name>: <state>}}
  models      list of {model} served on the /v1 lane (mios-llm-light /v1/models)
  uptime_s    int

CPU model name, logical core count, and load average (1/5/15 min) plus
    a derived load-vs-cores hint. /proc + os only -- no extra deps. Missing
    fields come back null (never a fabricated default), matching the rest of
    this probe. Added 2026-06-04: system_status carried NO cpu field, so a
    "CPU status?" question had nothing to report and the local-state formatter
    mislabelled the GPU block as 'CPU'.

OS identity -- the field the chat model needs so it STOPS guessing it runs
    on 'Windows 10' (its base-model prior) when the SOUL says host facts come from
    this tool ONLY. Every value is probed LIVE (no hardcoded OS string) and
    degrades to null on failure, so the model reports 'couldn't determine' instead
    of inventing. On WSL2 the WINDOWS HOST caption is probed best-effort via
    mios-windows ps -> the agent learns the real host (e.g. 'Windows 11 Pro for
    Workstations 10.0.x'), not the NT-10.0 'Windows 10' prior.

mios-sysview -- native system-inspection tool: the SSOT for the

to hardcode INLINE. Operator 2026-05-21: "no hardcodes ... should all be
native tools/skills/recipes ... unless baked in the modelfile or docs".

These ops build their command from TYPED, OPTIONAL args (conditional flags
-- e.g. `-u UNIT` only when a unit is given), which static [recipes.*]
templates can't express. So they live here as a helper TOOL (the same
pattern as mios-system-status), and agent-pipe's arms just delegate to it
-- the command literals are gone from the dispatch code.

### mios-text-edit -- native text-editor primitive. Replaces...

mios-text-edit -- native text-editor primitive.

Replaces the fragile `pc_type` + `pc_key ctrl+s` chain the
Phase A.1 planner used to emit for "open notepad and type X
then save". Synthetic keystroke editing fails for many reasons
the operator has hit in production:

  * The focused window may not be the editor (race on
    focus_window).
  * Special characters in the body get re-interpreted by the
    target's IME / autocomplete.
  * `ctrl+s` triggers different dialogs depending on app state
    (Save As on a never-saved doc).
  * No way to verify the write landed.

Native file ops bypass all of that: read / write / replace /
insert against the filesystem directly. The agent gets an
exit_code + structured result instead of "did the keypress
sequence work or not". Mirrors Anthropic's text_editor_*
schema shape (view / create / str_replace / insert) so prompt
patterns developed against that ecosystem transfer cleanly.

Subcommands:

  view PATH [--start N] [--end M]
                       If PATH is a directory: list non-hidden
                       entries up to 2 levels deep. If a file:
                       print the file with 1-indexed line
                       numbers; optional --start / --end to
                       restrict the range (inclusive bounds).
                       Defaults to first 200 lines on huge
                       files so the agent doesn't blow its
                       context window.

  create PATH --content @file
                       Create a new file. Fails (exit 1) if
                       PATH already exists -- use str_replace
                       or insert to mutate an existing file.
                       Creates parent directories implicitly.

  str_replace PATH --old @file --new @file
                       Exact-match replace. The old string must
                       occur EXACTLY once in the file; multiple
                       matches or zero matches both fail. This
                       is the "atomic edit" primitive -- pair
                       with `view` to verify the target string
                       exists before the replace.

  insert PATH --line N --content @file
                       Insert content AFTER line N (1-indexed).
                       --line 0 prepends to the file. Idempotent
                       w.r.t. the agent's ability to verify via
                       `view` after the call.

`--content @file` / `--old @file` / `--new @file` arguments
support three forms (same shape as mios-passport / mios-skills):

  @PATH      read from a path
  -          read from stdin (one arg only)
  literal    the raw string

Output is structured JSON with a fixed shape:

  {"ok": true,  "verb": "view",   "path": "...", "result": "...", "bytes": N}
  {"ok": false, "verb": "create", "path": "...", "error": "exists"}

so the agent / dispatch layer parses a stable envelope instead
of free-text. The CAPTURE_JSON: broker protocol picks the
stdout up verbatim.

Reject path-traversal + writes to system paths. Returns None

mios-tool-search <query> [--limit N] [--json]

Natural-language search over the agent-pipe verb catalog. Calls

nomic-embed-text + cosine-scores against the cached embeddings of
every visible verb (tier=core or common; tier=rare hidden).

Returns top-k {name, sig, desc, tier, score}. Used by the planner
when no listed verb obviously fits an intent -- progressive-disclosure
pattern from RAG-MCP (arXiv 2505.03275): instead of stuffing the full
catalog into every planner turn, plan with a small core set + this
retrieval verb for the rest.

Operator 2026-05-25 (4A): "the iGPU's always-on daemon-agent ... runs the
Definition-of-Done success check; the main agent/sub-agents just delegate and
read the success signal." The daemon already runs a post-hoc launch_verifier
loop (it scans recent chats and records false launch-success claims to
/var/lib/mios/daemon/launch_failures.json). This verb closes the loop
SYNCHRONOUSLY: after an agent fires an OS-control verb (open_app / window /
pc_*), it calls `verify_launch {app}` and gets the daemon's consolidated
verdict -- a live read-only window/process probe (mios-window-active --present,
which never launches anything) PLUS the daemon's own recorded false-success
history for that app. The agent then retries or reports honestly instead of
blind-claiming success.

GLOBAL tool (operator: ALL agents/sub-agents/nodes use ALL tools globally),
reached through the broker like any other verb. Offline-first: if the daemon is
down it returns success=false with an honest error -- it NEVER fabricates a
launched=true.

mios-viking -- OpenViking-style viking:// VFS over the local second brain.

P5.2 (OpenViking brief): a virtual filesystem with HIERARCHICAL TOKEN GATING
(L0 abstract -> L1 overview -> L2 raw) over MiOS's LOCAL knowledge stores --
NO external ByteDance container, NO cloud, fully offline. The agent skims L0
abstracts for navigation, targets a node, reads its L1 overview, and only
fetches the L2 raw detail on strict demand -- so the active context window is
never flooded with full documents.

NAMESPACES (viking://<ns>/...):
  skills     -- the episodic SKILL.md files (/var/lib/mios/ai/skills/episodic)
                written by the self-learn loop (P5.7).
  knowledge  -- the Postgres+pgvector `knowledge` table (every finished Q+A).
  memory     -- the operator AI memory dir (/var/lib/mios/ai/memory), if present.

TIERS:
  l0  -- one-line abstract (cheap nav). For skills/knowledge the stored
         goal/question IS the L0; otherwise mios-summarize generates it.
  l1  -- structured overview (mios-summarize, generated on read).
  l2  -- the raw node content.

USAGE
  mios-viking ls skills [--limit 20]

fabricated (e.g. invented a "car" etymology + cited the alphabet page) when a
snippet didn't actually contain the answer (operator 2026-05-23). web_extract
fetches the ACTUAL page text so an agent can GROUND on real content -- or, when
the page does not contain the answer, see that it doesn't and say so.

Offline-first: plain stdlib fetch (no cloud AI), crude HTML->text strip. Pairs
with web_search (search -> pick a URL -> extract its content -> ground).
SSOT: limit/timeout via flags; no endpoints to configure.

### mios-web-search -- native WEB-search verb backend...

mios-web-search -- native WEB-search verb backend (concurrent fan-out).

Queries the LOCAL, self-hosted SearXNG metasearch (offline-first; NO cloud
AI dependency -- Architectural Law 5) and returns clean, citable results so
agents GROUND current-world answers (weather, news, events, prices, facts,
general knowledge) on REAL fetched data instead of fabricating from model
memory.

Operator 2026-05-21: the chat agent invented a weather report -- wrong city
(Port Hope vs. the asked-about Toronto), wrong units (Fahrenheit for a
Canadian user), and made-up event details -- because NO web_search verb
existed; only filesystem search (everything_search / fs_search) did, whose
own descriptions tell the model to "use a WEB search" that was never wired.
SearXNG was already up (:8800) and advertised as the web_search backend.

Operator 2026-05-22: "have web tools shoot off more web queries concurrently".
QUERY FAN-OUT (--fanout K, the industry pattern behind Google AI Mode /
RAG-Fusion / ParallelSearch): expand one query into K diverse sub-queries via
the always-warm micro-LLM, fire them at SearXNG CONCURRENTLY, then merge with
Reciprocal Rank Fusion + URL dedupe. K parallel queries overlap latency (8
parallel ~= 300-500ms vs ~200ms single) and surface evidence one phrasing
misses. SearXNG's own limiter is off + granian workers are bumped so the
local instance absorbs the burst; agent-pipe bounds CROSS-agent concurrency.

SSOT: SearXNG endpoint = $MIOS_SEARXNG_URL; micro-LLM = $MIOS_MICRO_MODEL /
$MIOS_MICRO_ENDPOINT (same as agent-pipe); fan-out knobs = $MIOS_WEB_FANOUT /
$MIOS_WEB_FANOUT_WORKERS / $MIOS_WEB_RRF_K; the anchor stopword screen =
mios.toml [search].anchor_stopwords ($MIOS_WEB_ANCHOR_STOPWORDS CSV) -- all
rendered from mios.toml. The localhost fallbacks + the documented default
screen are the only literals, matching the unit/SSOT defaults. The query
tokenizer is unicode-aware (CJK/accented scripts tokenize, never to zero).

One SearXNG JSON query. Returns the FULL result list (caller slices)
    plus instant answers + infoboxes. category='news' targets SearXNG's NEWS
    engines (dated stories) instead of the general web -- operator 2026-05-24: a
    vague 'current global trending' matched the 'Current' banking app + 'electric
    current' (Wikipedia) on general search; the news category returns real dated
    news stories. time_range (day|week|month|year) recency-filters the GENERAL
    web -- operator 2026-05-25: this instance's news ENGINES are IP-blocked so the
    news category returns only stale wikinews; a time_range on GENERAL search
    pulls CURRENT content (CNBC/Reuters/FT/2026 outlooks) and drops the evergreen
    Wikipedia / stale-listicle junk WITHOUT needing the blocked news engines.

mios-win-scan -- Wine-free native Windows app/game enumeration off /mnt.

The Windows-side PowerShell scans (Get-StartApps / Get-AppxPackage / Steam
registry walk) only reach the real host through WSL-interop, which is silently
hijacked when a Wine binfmt handler intercepts .exe -- so they run in Wine's
fake Windows and see none of the host's real software. Every source below is a
plain file on the drvfs mount, read directly with ZERO .exe execution.

Output (stdout), one line per app:  <name>|<launch-target>|<category>
  launch-target is whatever `mios-windows launch` resolves on the real host:
  a steam:// / com.epicgames.launcher:// URI, a shell:AppsFolder AUMID, or a
  filesystem path (.lnk / .exe) that the executor Start-Process'es.

Law 10 keeps these four out of install.env -- a space, parentheses or a
{} placeholder, or an empty value the resolver drops -- while ExecStart
references each BARE, which the renderer leaves for systemd to expand.
Without a supply here systemd expanded all four to the empty string
(T-1064). `mios-gate protected-refs` fails the build on the general case.

T-1035. Each entry pins path:KEY=VALUE, not just path:KEY. A key-only register
cannot tell the shipped placeholder from an operator's real password: setting
MIOS_PG_PASS in the build environment bakes that value into a 0644 file under
/usr and the key-only gate stayed green. Every value below is a placeholder
and none is a secret; changing any of them is a NEW finding by design.

Shrink-only, and set to the measured count so the next untagged file

The scope this registry is measured against. `mios-gate projection-coverage`
reads these globs, enumerates what they match, and asserts every hit is on
`surfaces` above or itemised on `exempt` below -- the reverse direction that
`check_projection_registry` (forward only) never asked. Single `*`, final
path segment only; a pattern the matcher cannot express is a hard error, not
a silent widening.

<!-- mios-src:4e78848ac35e from usr/share/mios/mios.toml:2203-2208 -->

### Law 10 BARE-SAFE-ENV

Law 10 BARE-SAFE-ENV: /etc/mios/install.env is bare KEY=value, readable by
all three parsers (systemd EnvironmentFile=, bash source, podman --env-file).
A value carrying whitespace, a quote, `$`, a backtick or `#` cannot be written
bare without changing what it means, so system-sync-env.sh skips it.

Skipping SILENTLY is the defect: MIOS_AI_ENDPOINT was dropped this way and
Law 5 routes every agent through it (T-1060). These keys are declared, with
the reason each value cannot be bare; ANY other unsafe value now fails the
render instead of vanishing. Shrink-only: max_declared comes down as values
are made bare, never up.

### Law 11 SECRETS-NEVER-IN-ENV

Law 11 SECRETS-NEVER-IN-ENV: secret-bearing environment variable names

system-sync-env.sh, and mios-gate credentials.rs.

### How a floating ref ("latest") becomes a concrete one at...

How a floating ref ("latest") becomes a concrete one at bake time when its
upstream publishes no `latest`: a tag counts only if it matches one of these
release shapes, shapes are tried in order, and the highest version of the
first shape that matches anything wins. Read by mios-bake-plan latest-image /
latest-git. A suffix (-rc1, -amd64, -rootless) never matches, and lowercase
letter series (alpha tags) never match git_shapes.

### T-1037. miosd Check implementations that were never...

T-1037. miosd Check implementations that were never written: their `run` takes
`_ctx`, never reads the tree, and returned a constant Verdict::Pass with a
message CLAIMING verification. Containerfile:103 invokes this suite at every
bake, so the bake's own gate was certifying a tree it had not read -- pointed
at a directory that does not exist it reported "55 passed". They now report
Verdict::Skip("NOT IMPLEMENTED: ..."), which is the truth, and are registered
here shrink-only: implement a check and take it off the list; a new stub fails
the gate. Gate: `mios-gate drift-stubs`.
Ceilings that are GENERATED budgets rather than shrink-only ratchets, so
check_ratchet_direction lets them rise. Itemised with a reason on purpose: a
bare key here is indistinguishable from a silent skip, and a skip nobody can
see is how a gate stops being one. An entry naming something that is not a
ceiling is a finding, so a stale exemption cannot lie in wait for a future key
of that name.

A TABLE of key -> reason, deliberately not an array of inline tables: that
shape renders differently in the two resolver twins, and its registered
divergence set is a shrink-only 12 that a thirteenth key breaches
(check_resolver_differential_parity). Law 13 costs a shape here.

### T-1047. Budget keys that MUST exist in [agent_pipe] or...

T-1047. Budget keys that MUST exist in [agent_pipe] or [dispatch].

Enumerating the tables catches a key ADDED with no consumer. It cannot catch
a key DELETED, because a deleted key is simply absent from the enumeration --
the set shrinks and nothing is missing from it. The hardcoded nine-name list
this replaced was doing two jobs and only one of them was the defect; this is
the other one, moved out of Rust source and into SSOT where an
operator-tunable registry belongs (Law 7).

Seeded with exactly the nine the old constant named, so the floor is no
weaker than what it replaced. Removing an entry here is removing a guarantee:
do it only when the knob is genuinely retired.

### [agent_pipe]/[dispatch] keys that SSOT declares and NOTHING...

[agent_pipe]/[dispatch] keys that SSOT declares and NOTHING reads.
Shrink-only, and the ceiling may never sit above the measurement. Itemised
rather than a bare count: a count lets one dead key swap for another without
the gate noticing, which is the defect [docs] already carries.

mios-aiplane-lint walks all 128 scalar leaves under both tables. It used to
walk a hardcoded list of nine, so these nine were invisible: an operator
could set any of them and nothing would happen, silently.

Each is a knob with no reader. Wire it or delete it -- do not just move the
ceiling. `reflexion_limit` and `tool_loop_limit` are named by
tools/drift-checks.py, but only as keys it asserts are PRESENT; naming a key
is not consuming it, and that is exactly how they stayed dead.

### T-1038. Phase scripts present in automation/ that build.sh...

T-1038. Phase scripts present in automation/ that build.sh does NOT run.
Shrink-only, and the ceiling may never sit above the measurement.

The register is empty as of T-1018 stage 5. It previously held
55-native-build.sh on the reasoning that registering it would put miosd on
PATH -- its `ln -sf "${DEST_DIR}/${bin}" "/usr/bin/${bin}"` is the only such
line in the tree -- and so arm the `command -v miosd` gates in every stage
numbered above 55, producing a split brain inside one bake.

That reasoning read the script instead of measuring whether the line runs.
55-native-build.sh guards its whole body on `command -v cargo`, no [packages]
section installs a Rust toolchain, and no phase dnf-installs one: in a bake
the stage prints its "cargo toolchain not available" warning and does nothing.
The binaries in the image come from the Containerfile's rust-builder stage,
COPYed to /usr/libexec/mios, which is not on PATH -- so no stage, above or
below 55, has ever reached its Rust branch. Registering 55 arms nothing.
It also cannot change which phases run: build.sh selected via the
automation/[0-9][0-9]-*.sh glob (build_catalog_authoritative = false and no
build_phases.json), and that glob already included 55.

A hand-written list was wrong twice in a row: server.py's import chain reaches

declares what it needs, so the runner installs THAT and the list cannot drift

One page per SOURCE DIRECTORY, matching `_distill_dest`'s grouping --
not one page per source FILE. A per-file destination fans out into

legibility ratchet's tracked_files ceiling the moment this bulk
migration is committed, for no documentation benefit: an operator
already navigates the manual by directory, not by original filename.

Raised from 3065 (prior raise: 3032->3065, same cycle): 56 new tracked
manual pages produced by resolving MON-027/MON-028 -- the pre-existing,
out-of-scope docs-ratchet and no-duplicate-value-key drift-check failures
flagged onto /goal in the prior session. Fixing docs-ratchet REQUIRES this
ceiling to rise: the gate's own remedy is "harvest narrative comments and
overlong AI-hints into docs/, do not raise the docs ceiling" -- every
harvested page is a NEW tracked file, so the two ratchets are in direct
tension by design and tracked_files is the one built to absorb that
growth. 20 top-level usr/share/doc/mios/manual/*.md pages came from
`mios-manual distill` (Day-N+1 narrative-comment migration, non-destructive,
comments untouched in source) plus one manual `mios-manual harvest --path
usr/share/mios/mios.toml` pass (mios.toml is distill's own
[docs.distill].skip_globs exclusion, so its 23 MIGRATE blocks needed an
explicit --to). 36 usr/share/doc/mios/manual/_harvest/*.md pages came from
`mios-manual harvest --class overlong-hint --apply`, migrating over-cap
AI-hint header prose out of source comments; that command's destination
scheme was fixed in the same change (usr/libexec/mios/mios-manual) to group
by source DIRECTORY like `_distill_dest`, rather than emitting one page per
source FILE -- the original per-file scheme would have added 373 tracked
files instead of 36 for the exact same content. Not itemised in
