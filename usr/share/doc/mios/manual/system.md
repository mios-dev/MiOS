Image-build (automation/72-hermes-agent.sh) installs the patched,
self-hosted React SPA into the venv's hermes_cli/web_dist. That's
where `hermes dashboard` looks by default, so no HERMES_WEB_DIST
override is needed in the happy path. If the SPA build was skipped
(no node/npm, network blocked, etc.), the dashboard exits early --
/usr/share/mios/hermes-agent/web_dist_stub holds the curl-recipes
fallback page; set the env var below to switch to backend-only mode:
  Environment=HERMES_WEB_DIST=/usr/share/mios/hermes-agent/web_dist_stub

Enable the /chat tab (xterm.js + /api/pty WebSocket). Upstream
default is OFF for security. Here we enable + override the spawned
child via HERMES_PTY_SHELL (a MiOS-side patch in
hermes_cli/web_server.py, installed by automation/72-hermes-agent.sh).
Result: dashboard /chat shows a real bash login prompt rendered by
xterm.js in the browser. Loopback bind + per-session-token still
gate the endpoint -- anyone who can read the dashboard URL+token
gets a shell as the mios-hermes uid (the service's User=).

### usr/lib/systemd/system/hermes-worker.service The MiOS...

/usr/lib/systemd/system/hermes-worker.service

The MiOS Hermes WORKER (P1, operator 2026-06-19). A SECOND `hermes gateway
run` instance, fully ISOLATED from the live Discord gateway on the `hermes` port:
  * SEPARATE HERMES_HOME=/var/lib/mios/hermes-worker => its own gateway.pid /
    gateway.lock / gateway_state.json / state.db / kanban.db / config.yaml.
    No shared-DB WAL contention with the `hermes`-port instance.
  * API_SERVER_PORT=8643 (the LOAD-BEARING bind var -- `PORT` is inert; Hermes
    reads API_SERVER_PORT and otherwise binds its built-in DEFAULT_PORT).
  * NO discord.env / NO DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN => the Discord adapter never calls
    _acquire_platform_lock('discord-bot-token', ...), so the host-global
    gateway-locks/discord-bot-token-*.lock held by the `hermes`-port gateway is never
    contended (no SIGTERM flap). Discord stays the EXCLUSIVE job of that gateway.
  * NO --replace: the worker's HERMES_HOME-scoped pidfile is its own; the
    `hermes`-port gateway's eviction scan is profile/HERMES_HOME-scoped (only --all
    crosses profiles, which is not used) so neither instance touches the other.

This worker is the WORKER-DISPATCH target of [agents.hermes].endpoint in
mios.toml (repointed from the heavy lane to :8643 in P1). It does its OWN heavy-lane
inference (mios-heavy, port key `vllm`) so it never relays to the `agent_pipe` port -- no recursion.

COMPLETION CAP (operator 2026-06-19 P1 fix): mios-heavy max_model_len=65536; with
NO cap hermes lets the completion default to the full 65536, so input+completion
overflows -> HTTP 400 "token count exceeds maximum context". Cap the per-call
output so input has room (8192 leaves ~57k for input; enough for the reasoning
model's reasoning_content + answer). HERMES_MAX_TOKENS wins over model.max_tokens.

### Enforce world-readable perms on /usr/lib/containers/storage...

Enforce world-readable perms on /usr/lib/containers/storage so that
unprivileged podman / flatpak / etc. callers can read the additional-
image-store baked into the OCI image.

Why this exists: the bake step in /Containerfile chmod's the store at
OCI build time (commit a85925d, May 2026), but operators on stale
pre-fix OCI images don't have that fix in their image. The result is
the recurring "configure storage: open ...overlay-images/images.lock:
permission denied" symptom that breaks flatpak shims, the operator's
`podman info`, and any GUI launch chain. Operator-confirmed regression
2026-05-15 (post-fresh-install on a stale image).

This unit runs early in boot (Before=podman-restart.service +
Before=hermes-agent.service so anything that touches the store sees
correct perms) and is idempotent: chmod -R go+rX is a no-op on
already-correct dirs.

### The venv python is baked into the FINAL image, but on the...

The venv python is baked into the FINAL image, but on the podman-MiOS-DEV substrate it is
built at first boot by mios-ai-firstboot. Skip (rather than 203/EXEC-fail) until it exists,
so the unit never lands in a "failed" state during the firstboot venv-build window; firstboot
`systemctl restart --no-block`s it once the venv lands (R8 still holds: no After= edge here,
so no blocking on the multi-GB model download).

Run with the mios-hermes supplementary group so the service can read
/etc/mios/hermes/api.env (mode 0640, group mios-hermes) and load the
backend API_SERVER_KEY. Without it, _BACKEND_KEY stays empty and KEYLESS
direct callers (Firefox Smart Window, curl, MCP) reach Hermes with no auth
and get 401 -- only the OWUI path worked because it forwards the operator
token. The agent-pipe fronts Hermes, so sharing its key group is intended.

<!-- mios-src:424b25023a25 from usr/lib/systemd/system/mios-agent-pipe.service:30-35 -->

### SSOT chain

SSOT chain: every operator-tunable knob sources from mios.toml via
/etc/profile.d/mios-env.sh, which exports MIOS_* into the service
environment. The service code reads MIOS_PORT_AGENT_PIPE +
MIOS_AGENT_PIPE_BACKEND + MIOS_DB_URL etc. as os.environ overrides.

### WS-10 (operator 2026-06-05 "EVERYTHING IS LLAMA.CPP"): the...

WS-10 (operator 2026-06-05 "EVERYTHING IS LLAMA.CPP"): the agent-pipe
reasons DIRECTLY on mios-llm-light (port key `llm_light`) instead of via a Hermes hop. All
inference is on the dGPU via llama.cpp.
2026-06-15 (Claude): model fleet swapped gemma4:12b -> granite4.1:8b (the served
brain on mios-llm-light; see mios-llm-light.yaml + mios.toml:4061). gemma4:12b is
NO LONGER SERVED -> any role still naming it 404s on llama-swap ("no model id").
Align EVERY pipeline role to the ONE resident served brain (granite4.1:8b): set the
BASE default MIOS_STACK_MODEL (which _MICRO/DCI/SWARM/refine/polish/planner inherit
via server.py) + the explicit BACKEND/SWARM/MICRO names. ONE resident model = no
llama-swap thrash. Override per-deployment in /etc/mios/agent-pipe.env.
WS-0B: the agent-pipe reasons DIRECTLY on the light lane (NOT fronting Hermes
on the `hermes` port). Opt in by FLAG -- server.py composes the URL from _LIGHT_BASE, so the
port lives in ONE place ([ports].llm_light), not a literal here. MICRO/ROUTER/
LLM_CPU/PLANNER/REFINE/POLISH endpoints ALSO derive from _LIGHT_BASE now and
are no longer pinned in this unit.

<!-- mios-src:fcd7ab5afd0f from usr/lib/systemd/system/mios-agent-pipe.service:50-64 -->

llama.cpp/mios-llm-light (port key `llm_light`) is OpenAI /v1 ONLY (no legacy /api/chat, /api/ps)
and 400s on tool_choice=required. Register it so the pipe treats it as llamacpp:
skip forced tool_choice (no 400) + use the /slots KV-paging path. No bare port
literal in routing code -- these are the env-SSOT hint lists.
llama.cpp b9519 (the dGPU mios-llm-light) ACCEPTS tool_choice=required (verified) --
only the older iGPU b9305 (:11436) rejects it. So `llm_light` must NOT be in the
no-tool-choice list, or the pipe drops/auto's tool_choice and gemma4 NARRATES
the call instead of executing it. Keep `llm_light` in KV_PAGING (it does /slots).

<!-- mios-src:14a9c500f03c from usr/lib/systemd/system/mios-agent-pipe.service:71-78 -->

### WS-0B

WS-0B: ROUTER + the CPU-offload light-lane (MIOS_LLM_CPU_ENDPOINT) both now
default to _LIGHT_BASE in server.py (mios-llm-light) -- no per-endpoint pin here.
Override either via /etc/mios/agent-pipe.env only if a deployment splits lanes.
Phase A.1 -- planner runs on the dGPU/CUDA lane (the retired Ollama lane). Falls back to
whatever lane is reachable if that lane is down.
Model: mios-agent -- the canonical "MiOS AI" model (Modelfile FROM
qwen3.5:4b as of 2026-05-22 consolidation; was gemma4:e4b). ONE light
brain now serves plan + refine + polish with the full MiOS agent SYSTEM
(act-don't-narrate / right-tool-for-goal / SSOT mios-os-control surface,
ENGLISH-default, no hardcodes). The planner emits a single structured
verb/recipe DAG; if it ever empties, DAG mode degrades to the backend
proxy. Override via /etc/mios/agent-pipe.env.
History: qwen2.5-coder:7b -> mios-planner(gemma4) -> mios-agent(gemma4)
-> mios-agent(qwen3.5:4b, consolidated brain) 2026-05-22.
WS-0B: PLANNER endpoint+model both derive from server.py (_LIGHT_BASE +
MIOS_STACK_MODEL) -- no per-role pin here.
WS-A3 de-rot: the legacy DB (:8000) is RETIRED -> the agent DB is Postgres+pgvector
(MIOS_PG_* / mios-pgvector). The former MIOS_DB_URL/USER/PASS/NS/DB legacy env
is removed (the pg client reads MIOS_PG_* + the pgvector quadlet creds).
Phase C.3 -- this service signs agent-plane writes (pgvector + A2A) as agent-pipe.

### refine (input prompt-enhancement -> the structured plan...

refine (input prompt-enhancement -> the structured plan every downstream node
consumes; THE quality lever) + polish (final-answer shaping WITH the MiOS
persona) both run on the ONE resident served brain via the agent-pipe lane
resolver (mios-llm-light; the retired qwen3.5:4b/qwen3:1.7b dGPU Ollama-lane pins are
GONE). WS-0B: their endpoint AND model now derive from server.py (_LIGHT_BASE +
MIOS_AI_MODEL, the one owned keys) -- NEITHER is pinned in this unit anymore. The
CONCURRENT swarm secondaries still fan out to OTHER lanes at the same dispatch
step ([[mios_heterogeneous_parallel_dispatch]]). Override via
/etc/mios/agent-pipe.env only to split a lane.
Phase D.5 -- refine + polish timeouts on CPU-bound dev hardware.
Real ROCm/CUDA finishes the LLM call in <1s; WSL CPU takes 15-30s
for the same prompt. Generous timeout works on both.

Agent self-memory recall (operator 2026-06-20): inject the agent's OWN durable
self-edited facts (remember/memory_update -> agent_memory, embed-on-write) into
context so a "what did I tell you" / "what is my X" turn RETRIEVES the stored fact
instead of replying "I don't have that" (the WRITE half worked; the READ half was
default-OFF only to keep the hot path byte-identical until flipped). Safe: the
agent's OWN facts, same injection class as knowledge recall, NOT env-detection (the
no-context-injection rule is scoped to env discovery). RLS fail-closed still applies
under rls_mode=enforce; default rls_mode=off -> unchanged.

/usr/bin/python3 (operator-confirmed 2026-05-18: python3-fastapi is
in updates/, python3-httpx already installed). Switching to dnf
packages is the v1 follow-up; for the scaffold commit we ride the

Needs the agent-pipe up: mios-gen-role-system reads the LIVE /v1/verbs catalog
and mios-a2a-discover probes A2A AgentCards. avahi-daemon backs the mDNS browse +
advertise (FED-G5). ALL degrade-open, so a transient miss (or no avahi at all)
never wedges anything -- hence Wants, never Requires.

The 2026-06-05 install failure was a set -euo pipefail trap in the script

/usr/lib/systemd/system/mios-daemon.service

MiOS consolidated micro-LLM daemon. Replaces three predecessors
(mios-log-watcher + mios-cron-director + mios-agent-nudger) with
ONE process that subscribes to journald once, holds a single
qwen3:0.6b-cpu client (keep_alive=-1 forever, num_gpu=0 CPU-only
per Law 7 OFFLINE-FIRST + "always-on agentic OS"), and dispatches
the three handlers off a single event stream. Writes a unified
/var/lib/mios/daemon/state.json the OWUI mios_sidecar Filter polls.

DO NOT use Before=getty.target -- getty.target is WantedBy=multi-user.target,
so combining After=multi-user.target with Before=getty.target creates an
ordering cycle:
  multi-user.target -> mios-dashboard-issue -> getty.target -> multi-user.target
systemd breaks the cycle by deleting getty.target's start job, which means
NO console getty spawns at boot. The 2-minute OnBootSec timer + getty's

Ensure MiOS service ports are open in firewalld at every boot.

Why this exists: automation/44-firewall-ports.sh writes the firewalld
zone XML at OCI build time via firewall-offline-cmd. On stale OCI
images (pre-2026-05) OR when the install-time script didn't run / the
XML didn't persist, firewalld comes up with no ports open and ALL
Windows->WSL bridging silently times out (operator-confirmed
regression 2026-05-15: Open WebUI/Hermes/Cockpit/SearXNG inaccessible
post-reinstall; firewall-cmd --list-ports returned empty; adding the
ports manually instantly restored all 4 services).

This unit runs at every boot and is idempotent: --add-port on a port
that's already open is a no-op. No-ops cleanly when firewalld is
absent (ConditionPathExists) or inactive.

Apply MiOS's system-wide flatpak override policy at first boot
(XDG dir grants so every flatpak can read+write the operator's
Documents / Pictures / Videos / Downloads / Music / Desktop /
Public). One-shot; idempotent on re-runs.

Operator directive 2026-05-15: agent-installable flatpaks should
Just Work against /var/home/mios/* userspace folders by default,
without per-app override gymnastics. /var/lib/flatpak/overrides/
global is the right surface (mutable on bootc, survives image
upgrades, operator-editable via sudo flatpak override --system).

<!-- mios-src:7099d0cface4 from usr/lib/systemd/system/mios-flatpak-init.service:4-15 -->

### Hardening

Hardening: this service writes to a small set of paths plus calls
'podman exec' against the running mios-forge container. RestrictNamespaces
and RestrictAddressFamilies were tried but break Podman's CRIU/conmon
attach path on rootful container exec; we drop them and lean on the
read-write path scoping + ProtectHome instead, which is sufficient for
this script's actual surface area.

/run is LOAD-BEARING and must be writable as a whole: rootful
`podman exec` -- even a plain exec, no container lifecycle -- grabs
coordination locks across multiple /run subtrees: /run/libpod/
alive.lck (runtime init lock), /run/lock/netavark.lock (network
coordination), /run/containers/ (storage runroot). Listing them
individually is whack-a-mole; each missing one surfaces only at
runtime as "open <path>: read-only file system" (exit 125). /run is
tmpfs runtime state, so granting it RW is low-risk and is exactly
podman's requirement. That exit-125 failure is silent-deadly here:
forge-firstboot.sh's `admin user create` idempotency guard mis-reads
125 as "user already exists", so the admin is never created, the
repo-create 401s, the runner-token mint fails, and the entire
self-replication CI chain (runner-firstboot -> .runner ->
mios-forgejo-runner.service) stays dead behind unmet
ConditionPathExists guards. Operator-confirmed regression 2026-05-14.

### Runs AFTER the operator's Forgejo admin user and the empty...

Runs AFTER the operator's Forgejo admin user and the empty mios.git
repo are in place (mios-forge-firstboot.service drops the admin
password file and bootstraps the user). The script itself is
idempotent (/.git presence is the sentinel) and short-circuits if
Forgejo or the repo aren't reachable yet -- so re-running on every
boot is harmless.

Before=podman.socket docker.socket removed: combining DefaultDependencies=yes
(which implies After=basic.target -> After=sockets.target -> After=podman.socket)
with Before=podman.socket creates an ordering cycle that systemd resolves by
skipping all three GPU services. The service still runs before containers are
used because WantedBy=multi-user.target fires after sockets.target anyway.

Distinct from the primary :9222 browser (mios-hermes-browser.service): the CDP
supervisor attaches to the FIRST page target (Target.getTargets ->
next(type=='page')) over a shared browser-level socket, so two workers sharing
one browser would stomp each other's navigation/DOM/cookies. The launcher's
HERMES_BROWSER_CDP_PORT + HERMES_BROWSER_PROFILE_DIR overrides + profile-scoped

Headless ChromeDev (com.google.ChromeDev flatpak) with Chrome
DevTools Protocol on 127.0.0.1:9222 -- the CDP endpoint that
Hermes-Agent's browser tool attaches to (see browser.cdp_url in
/var/lib/mios/hermes/config.yaml). Operator directive 2026-05-15:
"Hermes-Browser isn't enabled!! Should be using the locally
installed ChromeDev flatpak install".

This is the LOCAL backend for browser_navigate / browser_snapshot /
browser_click etc. -- distinct from the cloud-mode backends
(Browserbase, Browser Use) the agent's browser_tool.py also
supports. Cloud mode kicks in automatically if the corresponding
API keys are present in the env; local-via-CDP is the MiOS default
(no off-host calls, no API keys, no cost).

HEADLESS (operator 2026-05-31 "fix the browser/CDP crash"): this SERVICE runs
ChromeDev headless so the CDP backend (:9222) comes up RELIABLY. History: the
unit used to set DISPLAY=:0 / WAYLAND_DISPLAY=wayland-0 to open ChromeDev
VISIBLY (operator 2026-05-16), with a comment claiming the launcher would
"auto-fall-back to headless on a host with no display." That assumption was
WRONG -- setting DISPLAY makes the launcher's auto-detect pick VISIBLE mode
(HEADLESS=0), and the WSLg display lives in the operator's INTERACTIVE session,
unreachable from this background (mios-ai, non-interactive) service -> Chrome
could not open a window and crash-looped (ran ~30s then died; CDP never bound,
so browser_navigate always failed "no CDP browser"). Forcing headless sidesteps
the display entirely; CDP is identical. To WATCH the agent browse in a visible
window, run `mios-hermes-browser ensure` from an INTERACTIVE session (real
DISPLAY) -- the launcher auto-detects it and opens headed there.

Use the PERSISTENT `start` path, not the default `ensure`: `ensure`
backgrounds Chrome and EXITS once CDP responds, but Type=simple then treats
that exit as "service stopped" and tears down the cgroup -- killing the very
Chrome it just launched (operator 2026-05-22: "DevTools listening" appeared
then the service went inactive). `start` exec's ChromeDev in the foreground
so it IS the main process and stays up; the agent's pre-flight
`mios-hermes-browser ensure` then just sees CDP already up.

Drain timeout: ChromeDev with CDP has no graceful in-flight protocol
(CDP clients can reconnect transparently). 30 s SIGTERM is plenty to
flush the on-disk profile + cookies. Consolidation 2026-05-15.

ProtectSystem=strict here would block /var/lib/flatpak read access;

PrivateTmp was true, but on WSLg the X11 display socket lives at
/tmp/.X11-unix/X0 -- a private /tmp hides it, so a VISIBLE ChromeDev
launch (DISPLAY=:0) can't reach the display and CDP never binds
(operator 2026-05-22). Off so the WSLg socket is reachable; the flatpak
sandbox still confines the browser itself.

NO ConditionPathExists=!/etc/mios/hermes/api.env. The old gate made
this unit a true once-ever oneshot -- but the script does TWO jobs:
(1) mint api.env (genuinely once), and (2) seed/heal
/var/lib/mios/hermes/config.yaml (must re-run when the Hermes config
SCHEMA drifts across upgrades, or when the container->direct-install
migration left $HERMES_HOME orphan-owned). The script is fully
idempotent -- it skips keygen when API_SERVER_KEY exists and only
rewrites config.yaml on detected drift -- so letting it run every
boot is cheap and self-healing. Operator-confirmed 2026-05-14: the
gate left a stale pre-0.13 config.yaml in place that the firstboot
rewrite could never reach.

Background tail of hermes-agent.service journal -- extracts in-flight
delegate_task + tool-call + retry + invalid-tool-call events, writes
/var/lib/mios/hermes-tail/latest.json which the OWUI mios_sidecar
Filter polls. This is the bridge that surfaces "what Hermes is
doing right now" into the OWUI chat stream via __event_emitter__,
per operator directive 2026-05-16 ("MiOS-Agent prints using OWUIs
emitters functions the current global statuses from

Runs as root so it has unrestricted journal read access; writes a
world-readable state file so mios-open-webui (uid 817, no
systemd-journal group) can poll without permission gymnastics.

Enforce go+rX on /usr/libexec/mios so services running as a DIFFERENT user
than the file owner can exec their scripts.

Why this exists: the deployed root / is a git working tree of mios.git. A
checkout without core.fileMode (or a committed source lacking the exec bit)
strips group/other execute from the libexec scripts, leaving them mode 0744
owned by the operator user. Any service that ExecStart's such a script as a
non-owner service user (mios-ai / mios-skills / mios-hermes / ...) then fails
EXEC with 203/"Permission denied" and crash-loops (observed: hermes-browser at
12k+ restarts, skills-miner failed, daemon/mcp inert). `chmod -R go+rX` is
idempotent and, via the capital X, only propagates EXISTING owner-execute --
it never makes a data file executable.

### Makes [agents.opencode] endpoint :${MIOS_PORT_OPENCODE_GATEWAY}/v1 a REAL OpenAI...

Makes [agents.opencode] endpoint :${MIOS_PORT_OPENCODE_GATEWAY}/v1 a REAL OpenAI endpoint so
agent-pipe's multi-agent fan-out (opencode secondary) + the primary path
(refine target_agent=opencode) can reach it. opencode has no native /v1
(its `serve` is opencode's own OpenAPI on :4096); this shim wraps
`opencode run`. FOSS + offline (opencode -> local mios-llm-light coder model).

FRONT-DOOR commitment (operator 2026-05-31): opencode is a first-class /v1
council peer via this gateway (NOT a Hermes ACP subprocess). The shim now
passes the FULL conversation (system + history) to `opencode run`, lands its
config at MIOS_OPENCODE_CONFIG, unifies the model id, and streams proper SSE
deltas. Deployed + enabled by the UNIFIED agent-plane install driver
automation/72-hermes-agent.sh: PHASE 1 builds the shared venv + Hermes,
PHASE 2 fetches the opencode binary + lands opencode.json. The gateway
server.py itself ships via the system-files overlay (this file's tree).

This unit lives in /usr/lib/systemd/system, which 34-render-quadlets.sh does
NOT process, and systemd does not expand env vars in User=/WorkingDirectory=/
ConditionPathExists=/ExecStart=. So the values below are LITERALS that MIRROR
mios.toml ([ports].opencode_gateway, [ai].opencode_*, [ai].agent_venv) — the
same convention hermes-agent.service uses. If a value changes in mios.toml,
update this unit to match.

Skip cleanly if the opencode binary never landed (build-time fetch failure)
rather than crash-loop; `mios update` re-runs 72-hermes-agent.sh (PHASE 2)
to complete it.

### Tighten ownership for the agents we know map to sysusers....

Tighten ownership for the agents we know map to sysusers. The
CLI itself runs as root (so it can chown after writing); these
post-steps narrow the private-key permission to the agent's
sysuser. We do NOT fail the unit if an agent's sysuser doesn't
exist yet (newer agents enrolled before their service ships) --
the `-` prefix swallows errors.
agent-pipe was CUT OVER to run as mios-ai (user consolidation), so its
passport private.key (0600) must be owned by mios-ai or the service can't read
it. Chowning to the OLD mios-agent-pipe left it unreadable by the mios-ai
service (operator-confirmed 2026-05-31: "passport: failed to load private key:
Permission denied" -> agent-pipe couldn't sign its agent-DB writes). hermes /
mios-daemon stay on their own sysusers below until their services are likewise
cut over to mios-ai.

group). USER/SYSTEM/AI separation -- the operator (`mios`) is in

Runs as root to `podman exec` into the mios-ai.pod pgvector container -- the SAME
proven pattern mios-sys-env-refresh uses. The pg listens loopback-only INSIDE the
pod (no PublishPort), so the old unprivileged host-side pg_dump could never reach
it (silent degrade). podman needs its runtime writable, so ProtectSystem=strict /
ReadWritePaths are dropped; keep the light hardening below.

Containers run ROOTFUL; any NON-root context -- the hardened agent-pipe
(User=mios-agent-pipe), the launcher broker, AND an operator's interactive
SSH/Termius shell -- running `podman ps` sees NOTHING (/run/podman is 0700
root:root). This root oneshot writes a READ-ONLY `podman ps` snapshot that
every non-root reader (portal, container_status verb, operator shell)
consumes instead. Operator 2026-05-23: containers invisible in the dashboard
AND in the Termius iPhone app -- same root cause.

WORLD-READABLE shared path: /var/lib/mios is root:root 755 (traversable by
all), and the file is chmod 0644 -- so the operator's SSH user can read it,
not just mios-agent-pipe (whose state dir is 0750 and blocked everyone else).

pgvector cache row. operator 2026-05-23: "probe systems/environment live +
store/update a mios-sys-env database".
systemd does NOT expand bash ${VAR:-default} in Environment= -- it passes the
LITERAL, unexpanded ${VAR:-default} string, which mios-pg-query then int()s ->
ValueError -> "pgvector upsert failed" on every run. Source install.env instead
so MIOS_PORT_PGVECTOR holds the real port; mios-pg-query reads it directly
(its own fallback is MIOS_PG_PORT or MIOS_PORT_PGVECTOR or 5432).

### WINE ships /usr/lib/binfmt.d/wine.conf which registers...

WINE ships /usr/lib/binfmt.d/wine.conf which registers binfmt_misc handlers
`windows` + `windowsPE` (interpreter /usr/bin/wine) that match ANY PE/.exe by
magic -- including /mnt/c/Windows/*.exe. When those win over WSL's `WSLInterop`
(interpreter /init), running a real Windows exe (powershell.exe, cmd.exe,
msrdc, the OS-control executor) launches it under WINE instead of on the real
Windows host -- so MiOS-Agent OS-control (window-list, launch verify, the
Windows executor) goes BLIND (count:0, WINE fixme noise in JSON). The WSL
2.8.x upgrade re-ordered binfmt so WINE won. Operator-hit 2026-06-06.

Fix: after systemd-binfmt registers everything, DISABLE the WINE handlers so
WSLInterop handles .exe. WINE apps still run via explicit `wine app.exe` (and
their .desktop launchers, which call wine) -- only bare ./app.exe auto-run via
binfmt is dropped, which is the right trade for a WSL distro whose primary job
is real-Windows interop.

### 'MiOS' WSL2 user-runtime-directory fallback. pam_systemd...

'MiOS' WSL2 user-runtime-directory fallback.
pam_systemd creates /run/user/<uid> on a real PAM login session. WSL2's
default-user invocation does open a PAM session, but `wsl -u root` followed
by `su - mios` bypasses pam_systemd and leaves /run/user/1000 missing,
which then surfaces as "Unsupported or missing session type ''" in GTK
apps, dconf "Permission denied", and dbus user-session failures.

This service unconditionally creates the directory for the canonical mios
user on WSL2 boots so the cascade can't happen. On a real logind session
the directory already exists -- install -d is idempotent and a no-op.

### WSL2 mounts /mnt/wslg/runtime-dir with mode 0777...

WSL2 mounts /mnt/wslg/runtime-dir with mode 0777 (world-writable),
but weston's wayland-server treats anything looser than 0700 as a
protocol violation and refuses to advance past the RAIL fallback
into VAIL (shared-memory) mode. Operator-confirmed via weston.log:
  warning: XDG_RUNTIME_DIR "/mnt/wslg/runtime-dir" is not configured
  correctly.  Unix access mode must be 0700 (current mode is 777)

This service runs ONCE at boot, BEFORE weston starts, chmoding the
directory to 0700. It's a precondition for VAIL; combined with WSL
2.7.3+'s shared-memory handshake (provided wslservice on the
Windows host successfully exposes the Section object), this should
nudge weston past COPY MODE into native VAIL rendering.

Note: this is a NECESSARY but not SUFFICIENT condition. Some
COPY MODE deployments persist due to host-side wslservice problems
that no Linux-side fix can address (per WSLg upstream issues #312,
#972, #982, #1278). When that's the case the warning disappears
but RAIL fallback stays -- diagnose via `WAYLAND_DEBUG=client
weston-info` on the host side.

/tmp/.X11-unix: WSL2 ships it as a SYMLINK -> /mnt/wslg/.X11-unix.
Flatpak bwrap chokes on symlinks ("Can't mount tmpfs on
/newroot/tmp/.X11-unix: No such file or directory") for any GUI app
that uses --socket=fallback-x11 (Nautilus.Devel, gnome-text-editor,
epiphany under XWayland fallback, etc.). Replace symlink with a
real directory + bind-mount the host's WSLg X11 socket dir onto
it so bwrap can chroot freely without losing X11 access.

Sanitize malformed flatpak-exported icons (a ".svg" that is really a PNG)

the wayland/X11 sockets refuse ALL clients (every GUI launch invisible).
