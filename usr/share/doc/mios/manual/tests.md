### Read the component lists from SSOT. A missing or empty list...

Read the component lists from SSOT. A missing or empty list is FATAL, not a
fallback: `for x in ${EMPTY}` runs zero iterations and the loop still prints
"OK", so an SSOT edit that dropped a list would turn this whole harness into a
vacuous pass. The old fallbacks also hardcoded paths (Law 7) and capitalised
them ("Usr/..."), so they could never have matched anything anyway.

### MUST run before anything else. check_ai_manifests_fresh...

MUST run before anything else. check_ai_manifests_fresh compares the
manifests against a fresh walk of automation/ and tools/, and dozens of
the tests below create, mutate and restore files in exactly those trees
(some restore via `echo "$orig" >`, which drops a trailing newline). Run
it last and it grades the wreckage of every preceding test instead of the
committed state.

Verify the ReWOO #E<id> substitution now smart-extracts a single
field instead of pasting the whole upstream JSON blob.

Test cases derived from operator's failure trace where the planner
emitted open_app(name=#En1) and substitution pasted mios_apps's
entire NDJSON output as the arg.

Smoke-test _substitute_ek_refs.

Verifies the ReWOO #E<id> placeholder substitution across the
shapes a planner might emit:
  * simple string substitution
  * multiple refs in one arg
  * refs to non-existent ids (preserved literal so dispatch errors)
  * non-string args (passed through)

Smoke-test the skill engine's expand_from semantics.

Calls execute_skill('open-url-fallback-chain', ...) with 3 browsers
and a deliberately-bad URL; verifies the engine fanned 1 step into
3 (one per browser) by inspecting the returned `steps` list length.

Exits 0 on PASS, 1 on FAIL.

<!-- mios-src:2cc352692064 from tests/test-expand-from.py:5-12 -->

### Smoke-test the refine chat-promotion guard. Calls...

Smoke-test the refine chat-promotion guard.

Calls refine_intent() with three actionable inputs that a small
refine model has historically misclassified as chat (operator-
flagged trace: 'mios-open-url https://...' returned intent=chat
+ fabricated 'Wikipedia has been opened' confirmation when nothing
was actually executed). Verifies the post-parse guard rewrites
chat -> dispatch.

<!-- mios-src:eeb00086dc8c from tests/test-refine-guard.py:5-13 -->

### Verify the new refine post-parse guards demote...

Verify the new refine post-parse guards demote misclassified
intents to `agent`. Three cases:

  1. Long multi-step prompt -- exact operator-flagged trace:
     "find all of my installed games; research all their ratings,
     review and launch the highest reviewed game I have installed
     for me on my PC". Refine model may emit intent=dispatch (as
     it did in the failure trace); the length guard should promote
     to agent so the planner can decompose.
  2. Short legitimate dispatch -- "open chrome". Should pass
     through as intent=dispatch (length under threshold).
  3. Multi-word arg value -- simulate a refine output via direct
     guard invocation (refine model is non-deterministic, so we
     can't always force it; this case is exercised by calling the
     guard logic directly with a forged envelope).

Live test against the real refine endpoint -- slow (15-30s per
call on CPU).

<!-- mios-src:7f133c2ab83a from tests/test-refine-guards.py:5-23 -->

### Smoke-test reflect_on_step_failure. Calls the reflection...

Smoke-test reflect_on_step_failure.

Calls the reflection helper with a deliberately-bad failed_node
(unknown verb) and verifies the small refine model returns a
correction with a non-empty tool name + rationale.

Live test -- hits the actual refine endpoint -- so it's slow
(15-30s on CPU) but exercises the real path.

<!-- mios-src:d63f63fff4d6 from tests/test-reflection.py:5-13 -->
### An Image= whose variable resolves nowhere used to be...

An Image= whose variable resolves nowhere used to be skipped silently,
which resurfaced as "core image is not referenced by any Quadlet" --
an error naming a different file entirely. The probe tag is deliberately
not MIOS_-prefixed: generate-names-registry harvests every MIOS_* token it
sees, so a MIOS_-named probe writes itself into referenced_names.txt and
the test starts editing the SSOT it guards.

<!-- mios-src:7140d10222ad from tests/drift-gate-negatives.sh:414-419 -->

### neg_gate once contained a literal backslash-n instead of...

_neg_gate once contained a literal backslash-n instead of line
continuations, so the command word became `n` and it returned 127 every
time. Under that, all 61 tests that call it could never detect anything --
`if _neg_gate X; then die` simply never fired -- while their restoration
arms died unconditionally. A helper 61 tests depend on has to be proven
before it is trusted, and proven in BOTH directions.

### Linux Clean Worktree Test & Drift Gate Execution

To run the full suite of drift checks and negative gate tests on a clean Linux environment:

```bash
# Set repository environment variables
export MIOS_DRIFT_ROOT="$(pwd)"
export MIOS_DRIFT_CHECK_ROOT="$(pwd)"
export MIOS_DRIFT_REQUIRE_TOOLS=1

# Run full drift check suite
bash automation/98-drift-checks.sh

# Run negative gate tests
bash tests/drift-gate-negatives.sh
```

Note: A stale installed MiOS on the host machine can fake SSOT-projection drift if `/etc/mios` or `/usr/share/mios` contains un-projected overrides. Always run with `MIOS_DRIFT_ROOT` pointing explicitly to the local workspace root.

<!-- mios-src:agy-1620 from docs/manual/tests.md -->
### Import this before importing `server`. Nine suites each...

Import this before importing `server`.

Nine suites each pointed the import search at the INSTALLED directory. A CI
runner has no such directory, so importing the server raised and every one of
those suites failed -- which is why none was ever wired into a workflow. A
developer machine that does have MiOS installed ran them against the installed
copy instead of the working tree, so the change under test was not the code
being tested.

Resolving from this file's own location fixes both: the repository copy comes
first, and the installed directory stays as a fallback for a suite executed
outside a checkout.

<!-- mios-src:0ab56d83257e from tests/_agentpipe_path.py:3-15 -->

### The suite mutates tracked files and is supposed to put them...

The suite mutates tracked files and is supposed to put them back. A test that
dies between the two leaks its fixture into the tree. Five reached the working
tree in one session -- an injected table in the shipped SQL schema, a root
password in a Ventoy firstboot script, a rewritten cockpit port, a capability
requirement replaced by an injected name, a port entry repeated twice -- and
each one surfaced as some unrelated suite failing, so the cost was paid several
times before anyone read the diff.

Snapshot everything the suite can reach before running, and put back whatever a
test failed to restore. The target list is derived from this file's own source,
so a test that starts touching a new path is covered without anyone updating a
list.

<!-- mios-src:59b3532038ab from tests/drift-gate-negatives.sh:10-21 -->

### 55-bake-quickshell.sh was renumbered to 66-. The whole body...

55-bake-quickshell.sh was renumbered to 66-. The whole body used to sit
inside `if [[ -f ]]`, so once the file moved the test skipped everything
and logged "passed" -- a test that reports success precisely when its
subject is gone. A missing target is now a failure.

<!-- mios-src:5b27437275f6 from tests/drift-gate-negatives.sh:1762-1765 -->

### Subshell

Subshell: die() exits the test, not the suite. One CI run then reports
every failure instead of the first, which is what turned a queue of
latent breakages into one round trip each.

<!-- mios-src:56662eab3f3b from tests/drift-gate-negatives.sh:2935-2937 -->

### REQUIRE_TOOLS is forwarded deliberately

REQUIRE_TOOLS is forwarded deliberately: checks that shell out to a built
binary choose between "skip" and "fail" on it, so a test that cannot set
it cannot exercise the failing path -- the path that matters.
Output is kept, not discarded: "failed after restoration" with no reason
has cost two CI round trips, and die() prints this on the way out.

A C-style header in a systemd unit is not a comment: the line is rejected,
and one such line in a WSL config failed a build twenty-nine minutes in.

<!-- mios-src:252855120d3e from tests/drift-gate-negatives.sh:3134-3135 -->

### The previous probe flipped `enabled` from false to true...

The previous probe flipped `enabled` from false to true, but the key has
been true for some time, so the sed matched nothing and the test asserted
against an unmodified tree. The check requires every merge-rule key to
have a table carrying origin_node and logical_ts, so declaring a rule with
no such table is the edit that loses data silently on rejoin (ADR-0017 D5).

<!-- mios-src:52fddbc14295 from tests/drift-gate-negatives.sh:3570-3574 -->

### The old probe moved bootc-fetch-apply-updates.timer aside...

The old probe moved bootc-fetch-apply-updates.timer aside, but that file
ships from an RPM and has never existed in this tree: it moved nothing and
the check "failed" for a reason the test never created -- a broken probe
and a broken check agreeing. The check now asserts the SSOT declares an
updater package and a bake phase wires its timer, so break the wiring.

### The registry is whatever mios.toml says it is. This test...

The registry is whatever mios.toml says it is.

This test used to snapshot `default_registry()` -- a six-phase hardcoded
list -- and call it golden, which blessed the very fallback that made a
six-of-seventy-one-phase build look complete. A golden over a constant
proves the constant has not changed, not that the loader works.

<!-- mios-src:4e84b507d438 from src/mios-rs/mios-build/tests/golden_harness.rs:41-46 -->

### The defect this port exists for. A key-only register...

The defect this port exists for. A key-only register grandfathers the KEY,
so an operator's real password baked in by a build-environment variable
reads as the same entry and the gate stays green.

<!-- mios-src:742c96b615ed from src/mios-rs/mios-gate/tests/credentials.rs:57-59 -->

### T-1043, and a bug in this gate's first predicate: naming...

T-1043, and a bug in this gate's first predicate: naming the parameter `ctx`
instead of `_ctx` proves nothing. check_pipeline_numbering read ctx.in_image
for an early skip and then returned a constant Pass, so a parameter-name test
classified it as implemented and it kept claiming a verdict.

<!-- mios-src:f2762f500bbf from src/mios-rs/mios-gate/tests/stubs.rs:80-83 -->

### The regression this file exists for. The shipped drop-in...

The regression this file exists for. The shipped drop-in,
usr/lib/bootc/kargs.d/01-mios-vfio.toml, is NOT wholly generated:
rd.driver.pre=vfio-pci binds vfio-pci in the initramfs before a
GPU driver can claim the card, and kvm-intel.nested=1 enables nested KVM.
Neither comes from any [kargs] key. A renderer that rebuilds the list from
scratch deletes both from the kernel command line, exits 0, and leaves a
header claiming the file came from SSOT.

<!-- mios-src:9e4749c8da2b from src/mios-rs/miosd/tests/render_kargs.rs:53-59 -->

### The old fixture was "set -e" plus an echo and no escape...

The old fixture was "set -e" plus an echo and no escape token. That is
not a Law 12 violation -- there is no egress to fail -- and the gate it
certified only ever tested for the substring. This fixture is the real
thing: an unguarded fetch reached with errexit active.

<!-- mios-src:63b36ce0a21b from tests/drift-gate-negatives.sh:982-985 -->

### The defect

The defect: the scan skipped every tree a consumer lives in, so no input
could make this gate fail. One plant per formerly-excluded tree, because
a single one would not show that the exclusion list is gone rather than
merely shorter.
Split so the literal never appears in this file: the names registry
harvests tracked sources, and a fixture name spelled out here lands in
usr/share/mios/referenced_names.txt as if something referenced it.

<!-- mios-src:88ebac152c52 from tests/drift-gate-negatives.sh:1980-1986 -->

### The bare second enforcer in a comma list inherits its file...

The bare second enforcer in a comma list inherits its file rather than
being dropped: the old reader split on comma first and skipped any piece
without a colon, so Law 12's second target was never checked.

<!-- mios-src:32d7b29b500e from tests/drift-gate-negatives.sh:2068-2070 -->

### T-1035

T-1035: the half a key-only register could not see. POSTGRES_PASSWORD is
GRANDFATHERED, so changing its value used to read as the same entry and
the gate stayed green while an operator's real password sat in a 0644
file under /usr.

<!-- mios-src:f4a756d53e6e from tests/drift-gate-negatives.sh:4004-4007 -->

### Padding

Padding: registering a table that HAS a consumer must fail -- the
register only shrinks, and an entry that no longer reproduces is debt
already paid. `blades` is read by its own fleet-safety gate.

Run cargo in the workspace on any platform.

Run the validator's own unit tests over its synthetic fixtures.

        Named for what it does: these are the crate's fixtures, NOT the live

        while asserting only on cargo output, which is the kind of gap this

Run a cargo command in the workspace, on whatever platform we are on.

    failed outright on any CI runner. Skip -- loudly -- when there is no

test-virtio-pmem-dax-io.py — T-734 WS-VFIO
Automated benchmark suite for virtio-pmem DAX microVM I/O.

In CI (no Cloud-Hypervisor available) all benchmarks run in dry-run / memory
simulation mode:
  - memfd allocation + mmap read simulates the >15 GB/s memory path
  - time.perf_counter timing asserts sub-25ms "boot" (memfd init) latency

On a real MiOS host with Cloud-Hypervisor:
  - Launches 10 sequential VMs, measures boot-to-init latency
  - Runs in-guest fio read benchmark, asserts >15 GB/s
  - Asserts host NVMe write counters unchanged

### The preset script is present when the tree carries it....

The preset script is present when the tree carries it.

        `src/autounattend/*` is git-ignored (.gitignore un-ignores the directory
        and then excludes its contents), so this script exists in a developer's
        working tree but never in a clean checkout -- which is why this assertion
        passed locally and failed on every runner. Tracking it is not the fix
        either: it is 56 lines of PowerShell against a shrink-only ps_lines
        ceiling that Law 14 keeps there deliberately. Skip where it cannot
        exist, and say so, rather than assert a file the repo excludes.

### mios-agents.service runs its ExecStartPre...

mios-agents.service runs its ExecStartPre (mios-agents-firstboot.sh) as root,
and that script seeds code-server settings and an extension into
/var/lib/mios/agents -- the container's coder home, owned by uid 1000 per
tmpfiles.d/mios-agents.conf. Created as root, those paths leave code-server
(running as the home's owner) unable to write its own User/ state.

Positive control: seeding a uid-1000 scratch home as root leaves every seeded
path owned 1000:1000. Negative control: the pre-fix seeding (plain install -d,
install and cp as root) is planted in a scratch copy and the same check must
name a root-owned path. The script is sourced -- it returns before its build
step when sourced -- with its home, settings and extension sources pointed at
the scratch fixture.

### Two-sided verification controls for Task T-1141. WHEN...

Two-sided verification controls for Task T-1141.

WHEN forgejo/pgvector/psycopg are unavailable THE SYSTEM SHALL order firstboot
seeders after them and surface the degradation instead of silently skipping.

Each check_* function RUNS the code under test against a scratch fixture and
returns the violations it observed. The positive controls require an empty
list from the shipped files; every negative control plants the pre-fix defect
in a scratch copy and requires the SAME function to name it. Nothing reads the
host: scripts run with their host paths rewritten into the scratch directory,
an empty PATH where they would otherwise find host tools, ambient MIOS_*
scrubbed, psycopg shadowed by a module that refuses to import, and pgvector
pointed at a port nobody listens on.

<!-- mios-src:d087fbdd6bad from usr/libexec/mios/test_mios_firstboot_seeders.py:5-18 -->

### T-1135

T-1135: WHEN mios-mcp.service starts THE SYSTEM SHALL have its MCP port
defined -- by the resolver-rendered /etc/mios/install.env, not a literal.

* the exports the resolver renders from the vendor mios.toml carry
  MIOS_PORTS_MCP / MIOS_PORTS_MCP equal to [ports].mcp;
* mcp-server-runner's preamble, run under exactly that environment (ambient
  MIOS_* scrubbed), resolves MIOS_PORTS_MCP to that value;
* neither the unit nor its [units."mios-mcp.service"] SSOT mirror assigns a
  MIOS_* port literal.

Negative controls: the same environment without the port names must stop
the runner with its named error, and a planted Environment=MIOS_PORTS_MCP=<n>
must be named by the literal check.

Empirical Adversarial Stress Test Suite for MiOS iGPU Inference Lane & RPC Compute Fabric.

Executes adversarial challenges across four core dimensions:
  1. Challenge 1: Localhost isolation & binding.
     - Live port 8540 detection & stale service audit.
     - Rejection of non-localhost connections.
     - Closed port handling & socket reconnection resilience.
  2. Challenge 2: Protocol payload stress.
     - Malformed JSON bodies, syntax errors, raw binary garbage.
     - Missing fields (model, messages), empty prompts, empty arrays.
     - Non-existent models, out-of-range temperatures.
     - Server survivability after adversarial fault injection.
  3. Challenge 3: Hardware routing integrity.
     - DirectX UserGpuPreferences registry verification (GpuPreference=1;).
     - Adversarial regex matrix for Vulkan device enumeration (AMD vs NVIDIA).
     - Live Vulkan device enumeration check.
     - RTX 4090 dGPU VRAM isolation check via nvidia-smi.
  4. Challenge 4: RPC fallback & Vulkan cooperative matrix handling.
     - Enforcement of GGML_VK_DISABLE_COOPMAT=1.
     - Vulkan matrix cores verification on AMD Radeon (matrix cores: none).
     - Raw TCP wire protocol fuzzing & malformed RPC handshake.
     - Coordinator --rpc and --tensor-split configuration validation.

Each consumer runs from a copy whose absolute state paths point into a temp
dir, with network and package tools replaced by stubs that log their calls. The
SSOT values come from the real resolver (usr/libexec/mios/mios-toml-get) reading
the checkout's vendor mios.toml plus a host drop-in dir, so the chain under test
is the one a cloud deployment runs: render -> drop-in -> merge -> gate.

### Entrypoint shim

Entrypoint shim: delegates to the canonical consolidated suite.

This filename stays because it is an externally referenced entrypoint
(registered in ``[ci.tiers] unit`` in usr/share/mios/mios.toml and mirrored in
usr/share/mios/ai/v1/metadata.json), but ALL refine guard coverage --
including this file's former live chat-promotion smoke cases
("mios-open-url https://www.wikipedia.org", "https://example.com",
"git status") -- now lives once, losslessly, in
``tests/test-refine-guards.py``, which exercises the REAL production
``refine_intent`` (imported from ``usr/lib/mios/agent-pipe/mios_refine.py``)
rather than an inline copy.

Running this shim == running the canonical suite (offline deterministic
guards verified; live integration tests SKIP explicitly unless
``MIOS_REFINE_LIVE_ENDPOINT`` is set).

<!-- mios-src:9e94a75ddae3 from tests/test-refine-guard.py:4-19 -->

### Refine post-parse guard suite (canonical, consolidated)....

Refine post-parse guard suite (canonical, consolidated).

Covers the REAL production guard -- ``refine_intent`` imported from its real
module path (``usr/lib/mios/agent-pipe/mios_refine.py`` re-exporting
``mios_pipe/routing/refine.py``) -- NOT any inline copy of its logic.

Two layers, honestly separated:

* Deterministic offline tests drive the real ``refine_intent`` through a
  canned OpenAI-compatible transport (the stub recipe the upstream unit suite
  ``test_mios_refine.py`` uses), so they need NO live model endpoint. They
  prove positive and negative controls for every guard: chat-promotion for
  actionable text, long-prompt promotion, short-dispatch passthrough,
  wordy-arg (arg-shape) demotion, multi_task shape repair, and
  malformed/failure behavior (backend error, unparseable prose, empty
  content -> None, never a fabricated result).

* Live integration tests (3, named ``test_live_*``) exercise the deployed
  stack through ``server.refine_intent`` (the traced production entrypoint).
  They are OPT-IN via ``MIOS_REFINE_LIVE_ENDPOINT``. When that env var is
  absent they SKIP explicitly -- under pytest as a reported skip, standalone
  as a printed ``[SKIP]`` line that is never counted as a passed check.

Standalone entrypoint (run-suites.sh unit tier)::

    python3 tests/test-refine-guards.py      # pass=N skip=M fail=K summary

History: this file consolidated (losslessly) the former
tests/test-refine-guards.py (3 cases) and tests/test-refine-guard.py
(3 chat-promotion smoke cases). The old case 3 validated an INLINE COPY of
the wordy-arg guard instead of the production function -- that defect is
fixed here by driving the real ``refine_intent`` with the forged envelope.

<!-- mios-src:0c5b20cb9280 from tests/test-refine-guards.py:4-36 -->

### Positive control

Positive control: a binary payload compressed by the production encoder
        must be a genuine Zstandard frame decodable by an INDEPENDENT decoder
        (zstd CLI when installed, otherwise the python zstandard module) and
        must round-trip byte-for-byte.

<!-- mios-src:7a90f183cc31 from tests/test-storage.py:237-242 -->

### Negative control

Negative control: when the located encoder binary exits non-zero, the
        operation must fail with ZstdCompressionError (no silent fallback to a
        fake frame). Uses the real Python interpreter as a failing "zstd" binary:
        it rejects zstd-style flags and exits with status 2.

<!-- mios-src:c7d295e00992 from tests/test-storage.py:387-392 -->

### Negative control

Negative control: corrupted, garbage, and mislabeled (zlib-with-zstd-magic)
        payloads must be rejected by the restore path, and a corrupted remote store
        chunk must fail verify_remote_manifest.

<!-- mios-src:cc942d15ffcc from tests/test-storage.py:427-431 -->

### Harness self-proof

Harness self-proof: a PLANTED invalid frame (exactly the shape the old
        defect produced: zlib bytes behind a zstd magic prefix) MUST fail the
        independent round-trip decoder and the production restore consumer.
        If this test ever passes silently, the round-trip harness is broken.

<!-- mios-src:8cb1ef5b66d7 from tests/test-storage.py:489-494 -->

### Validates magic packet byte construction
