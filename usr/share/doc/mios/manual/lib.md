### MiOS is cross-platform, and this module runs under pwsh on...

MiOS is cross-platform, and this module runs under pwsh on Linux too (CI
lints and Pester-tests it there). Every entry must therefore be built
defensively: on Linux $env:USERPROFILE is null, and `Join-Path $null ...`
throws ParameterBindingValidationException under StrictMode +
ErrorActionPreference='Stop', which took out the whole Pester suite.

Order mirrors the layered resolver contract used everywhere else in MiOS:
explicit env override, then user tier, then host tier, then vendor.

A trailing '_' means the regex stopped on a
non-name character, so this is a FRAGMENT, not a
variable: an f-string prefix (f"MIOS_A2A_{name}"),
a build-time template placeholder
(__MIOS_COCKPIT_PORT__), or a doc wildcard
(MIOS_COLOR_*). No emitted name ends in '_', so
these can never be satisfied and would wedge the
gate permanently.

### AI-hint

AI-hint: PowerShell script that displays and enforces legal/policy acknowledgments for interactive users, supporting bypass via MIOS_AGREEMENT_* environment variables to control entry-point access.
AI-related: mios-bootstrap
AI-functions: Get-MiOSAgreementSummary, Test-MiOSInteractiveHost, Show-MiOSAgreementScrollable, Invoke-MiOSAgreementBanner
automation/lib/agreements-banner.ps1 -- PowerShell sibling of
agreements-banner.sh. Dot-sourced by every PowerShell entry point in
'MiOS' (mios.git) and 'mios-bootstrap' (mios-bootstrap.git).

Behavior summary:
  * Default for an interactive operator: print a scrollable summary
    of the project's licenses, research-project framing, third-party
    agreements, and data/network posture, then require an explicit
    "Acknowledged" or "No thanks" choice.
  * Default for non-interactive runs (CI, no console host, irm|iex
    redirected through a non-RawUI host): print a one-line note and
    continue. There is no way to accept-by-prompt without a host UI.
  * Escape hatches (any one of these skips the prompt):
        $env:MIOS_AGREEMENT_BANNER = 'quiet' | 'silent' | 'off' | '0' | 'false'
        $env:MIOS_AGREEMENT_ACK = 'accepted'                # explicit accept
        $env:MIOS_REQUIRE_AGREEMENT_ACK = '0'                # explicit waive
  * CI users that need the prompt skipped should set
    `$env:MIOS_AGREEMENT_ACK = 'accepted'` -- declaring acknowledgment
    by external policy is more honest than silently bypassing.

Exit code 78 (EX_CONFIG) on decline, matching the bash sibling.

!/usr/bin/env bash
AI-hint: WS-A17 build-time materializer for the local package registry. Thin, flag-gated wrapper around `mios-registry generate`: when [ai].package_registry (MIOS_PACKAGE_REGISTRY) is true it projects the live SSOT catalogs into ai/v1/packages/<author>/<name>/<version>/mios-pkg.toml + registry.json; when false (the default) it is a no-op so the feature ships dormant. Sourced/called by the build (or run manually); never fails the build when the flag is off.

Configure rootful container storage on a fresh runner.

The runner's default graphroot sits on the small root filesystem and its
overlay defaults enable metacopy, which bootc images cannot use. Both
publishers need the same layout or a bake succeeds on one and fails on the
other for reasons unrelated to the change under test.

Assert the built image is bootc-switchable (Architectural Law 4).

The Containerfile's final layer already runs `bootc container lint`. This
re-reads the labels from storage so a lint that ran but did not take effect
is still caught.
