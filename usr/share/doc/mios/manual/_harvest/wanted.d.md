!/bin/bash
AI-hint: Non-critical greenboot check that probes blade reachability per ADR-0016 §8 / AGY-1600. Records reachability state without triggering a rollback unless blade_reachability_critical = true.

### MiOS Peripheral Hardware Health Evaluator...

==============================================================================
MiOS Peripheral Hardware Health Evaluator ("Degrade-Not-Refuse")

Architectural Invariant:
Peripheral subsystems (Network, Audio, Display/DRM) are evaluated during the
bootc boot cycle under Greenboot wanted.d. If any non-critical peripheral is
missing, misconfigured, or has failed driver initialization, this script
records the degraded state to the systemd journal, persistent log file, and
PostgreSQL hardware_events / hardware_inventory (when reachable).

Under the "degrade-not-refuse" architectural philosophy, this script MUST NEVER
exit non-zero on peripheral degradation or missing hardware. It explicitly
exits 0 so Greenboot promotes the boot deployment rather than triggering an
unwanted system rollback.
