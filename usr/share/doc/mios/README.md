# MiOS documentation

<!-- MIOS-GEN:boilerplate:what-mios-is -->
MiOS is one thing built two ways at once: an immutable, `bootc`/OCI-shaped
Fedora workstation -- the whole OS is a single container image, so `bootc
upgrade` behaves like a `git pull` and `bootc rollback` like a Ctrl-Z -- that
is *also* a local, self-hosted, agentic AI operating system.

<!-- derived from usr/share/mios/mios.toml [docs.boilerplate].what-mios-is -->
<!-- /MIOS-GEN:boilerplate:what-mios-is -->

This is the documentation baked into the image, readable on a booted host under
`/usr/share/doc/mios`. Every entry below is generated from that document's own
`AI-hint:` header, so this page cannot describe a file that no longer says what
it claims — see `reference/documentation-pipeline.md` for how that works.

## Start here

| If you want to | Read |
|---|---|
| understand what MiOS is and how it is put together | `concepts/architecture.md` |
| build, change or debug the image | `guides/engineering.md` |
| look up a port, a law, a build phase or a tool | `reference/` (below) |
| know why something was decided the way it was | `adr/` |
| read the prose distilled out of the source itself | `manual/` |

## reference

Lookup surfaces. Most of these are derived from `usr/share/mios/mios.toml`, so
they are correct by construction rather than by maintenance.
