# ADR-0016: Blade-Node topology — orthogonal lineage/role axes, and service offload as a URL overlay

## Status

**Accepted — all four decisions settled.** A seat is an **archetype**, not an image; the two
Hermes port keys **collapse into one**; blade-reachability as a boot-critical condition is
**configurable, defaulting to off**; and `Containerfile.minimal` is **deleted**. Decisions 1 and 2
were already mechanical consequences of what the tree is.

**Decision 3 is settled too, and it was settled by the requirement itself**: *"MiOS-Mini is the
full image just meant to offload all services to hosted (local, localhost or remote) MiOS OCI
image(s)."* That sentence assigns the name. **MiOS-Mini is the seat.** The hypervisor-router is
renamed **MiOS-Metal** and its SSOT surface moves `[mini]` → `[metal]`.

## Context

Three separate things in this repository currently answer to a variant of the name *mini*:

| Claimant | What it actually is | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| `[metal]` (was `[mini]`) + `mios-metal-architecture.md` | A **tiny headless hypervisor-router**: binds every dGPU to `vfio-pci`, owns the NICs/radios/TPM, and boots the *full* MiOS as a super-privileged guest VM | `bind_dgpu_vfio = true`, `dgpumode = "vfio-pci"`, `[metal.gpu].assignments`, `[metal.mesh]` headscale; 224-line architecture doc with decisions D1–D5 and risks R1–R10 |
| `Containerfile.minimal` (**deleted**) | A **base-lineage variant** on bare `fedora-bootc`. It could not build: 8 of the 9 phase scripts it named no longer existed | header called it *"MiOS-Lite"*, `STUB / EXPERIMENTAL`; removed with its three dead `[image].minimal_*` keys |
| The operator's stated intent | A **full-featured seat** that runs the whole UX but offloads every service to a hosted MiOS OCI image, local / localhost / remote | stated requirement |

The first two are not variants of each other, and neither is the third. They differ on **two
orthogonal axes** that the naming has collapsed into one:

* **Lineage** — which bootc base the image is built from (`ucore-hci` vs `fedora-bootc`). Affects
  size, inherited kmods, and upstream lag. Decided at bake time.
* **Role** — what the machine *does* (owns metal and hypervises; serves services to others; runs
  the UX and consumes services). Affects which units start and where addresses point.

Conflating them is why "mini" had three meanings. Deleting `Containerfile.minimal` removes the
lineage claimant outright: it named 8 phase scripts that no longer exist, so it had not been
buildable for some time, and its `[image].minimal_base/_tag/_name` keys had zero consumers and
were not even emitted. **Two claimants remain, both on the role axis**, which is what makes the
naming question tractable.

### What the tree can express today

Measured, not assumed:

| Fact | Value |
|---|---|
| Pods | **All three are `Network=host`.** No container publishes a port |
| `[urls]` coverage | **9 of 40** addressable ports have a canonical URL; the other **31 are hand-composed** in 1–18 files each |
| Consumers hand-composing an address | ~125 non-generated, non-doc files |
| `[blade]` **singular** | **Implemented.** `type = "hybrid"`, `[blade.archetypes]`, `[blade.requires]` — the OS-role activation axis |
| `[blades]` **plural** | **Zero keys.** An empty section under a 30-line comment about nodes — a different axis (see below) |
| `[admission].multiblade_enable` | `false` |
| `[nodes.*]` | 6 declared; **5 point at the same endpoint and the same model**; 1 ships empty |
| `[nodes.local-cpu]` | `lane = "gpu"`, endpoint = the GPU heavy lane. There is no CPU lane |
| `[greenboot].critical_services` | `agent-pipe`, `llm-light`, `pgvector` |
| `[quadlets.enable]` gated off | exactly **one** container |

### The role axis is already built — on a different SSOT key

`[blade]` singular and `[blades]` plural are one letter apart and are **not the same axis**:

| Key | Axis | Answers | State |
|---|---|---|---|
| `[blade]` (singular) | **OS role** — what *this* machine activates | "am I a gpu-serving box or a controller?" | shipping |
| `[blades]` (plural) | **Fleet** — which *other* machines serve me | "who else is out there and how big are they?" | empty |

The `[blade]` chain is complete end to end: `[blade.requires]` → `tools/generate-blade-dropins.py`
→ `usr/share/mios/dropins/blade-<cap>.conf` (each a bare `ConditionPathExists=/etc/mios/blade.d/<cap>`)
→ `automation/48-mios-dropin-fanout.sh` → `<unit>.service.d/50-blade-<cap>.conf`, with
`usr/libexec/mios/role-apply` materializing the `/etc/mios/blade.d/*` markers and `/run/mios/blade.env`,
`mios-{hybrid,compute,endpoint,controller,headless,desktop}.target` present, `usr/libexec/mios/mios-blade`
present, and `usr/lib/greenboot/check/required.d/10-mios-role.sh` present.

Three things WS-BLADE claims as `done` are **not** in the tree, and each matters to this ADR:

1. **`usr/lib/bootc/kargs.d/05-mios-blade.toml` does not exist.** `role-apply` parses `mios.blade=`
   and `mios.role=` out of `/proc/cmdline`, so the *reader* ships; the generated karg default does
   not. Deploy-time role selection therefore works only where the installer sets the karg by hand.
2. **`role-apply` was never demoted.** BLADE-01 specifies a marker-writing resolver; it still calls
   `systemctl set-default --no-block` and `systemctl start --no-block` on the resolved target. The
   declarative half (markers + `Condition*`) and the imperative half both run.
3. **`[profile]` was never folded into `[blade]`.** `[profile].role = "developer"` is not one of the
   archetypes `role-apply` accepts (`hybrid|compute|endpoint|controller|headless|desktop|k3s*|ha*`),
   and `role-apply` never reads `[profile]` at all. Two role systems, no edge between them —
   `"developer"` would fall through to `*) WARN: unknown role … defaulting to headless`.

`Network=host` is the load-bearing one. It means every service genuinely *is* on the host's
loopback, so a service's identity is **its port number** and nothing more — `_discover_portal_services()`
dedupes the entire service surface by port. It also means the ~600 `localhost` references across
the tree are not sloppiness; they are the architecture stating itself.

The consequence cuts both ways. Because there is no network namespace to re-plumb, **moving a
service to another machine is purely an addressing change** — but because service identity *is*
the port, there is currently nowhere to put the "which machine" half of the answer.

### Addressing is already wrong locally — Hermes as the worked example

Decision 1 is not tidying. Traced end to end, one service disagrees with itself five ways:

| Source | Port | Kind |
|---|---|---|
| `[ports].hermes` | 8720 | SSOT |
| `[ports].hermes_worker` | 8730 | SSOT |
| `hermes-worker.service` `Environment=API_SERVER_PORT=` | **8643** | literal in the only gateway unit that ships |
| `mios_pipe/kernel/config.py`, `context/grounding.py` fallbacks | **8642** | literal, and a **retired** port |
| `mios_pipe/health.py` fallback | 8720 | agrees with the SSOT |

`hermes-worker.service` is the *only* unit in the tree that runs `hermes gateway run`, and it binds
a port the SSOT assigns to nothing. `hermes.service` and `hermes-agent.service` — named by the
greenboot probe, by unit comments and by the drift-check's external-unit allowlist — have no unit
file, so `[ports].hermes = 8720` is addressed by `[urls].hermes` and by agent-pipe's backend while
**nothing binds it**. The greenboot line `check_service hermes.service "${MIOS_PORT_HERMES:-}" tcp`
is therefore dead twice over: wrong unit name, and a port with no listener.

The retired-port fallbacks are the general form: **17 executable `os.environ.get("MIOS_PORT_X",
"<retired>")` defaults across 12 files**, each naming the correct variable and defaulting to a port
`[docs].retired_ports` says is gone. `check_doc_port_scheme` enforces Law 5 only over
`[docs].port_clean` — a list of *documents* — so no gate has ever looked at the code. A missing env
var makes these talk to a dead port quietly instead of failing loudly.

This is the same shape as the empty-set failures elsewhere in the tree: **a gate that reports
success over a set that excludes the thing it checks.** It is also the strongest argument for
Decision 1 — "offload is only an addressing change" is a promise the tree cannot keep until one
service has one address.

**Resolved.** There is one Hermes, so there is now one key: `[ports].hermes = 8720`, which
`hermes-worker.service` binds. `hermes_worker` is gone, the greenboot probe names the unit that
exists, and all 17 executable retired-port defaults now carry their SSOT value.

Deleting the key exposed a second defect worth recording, because it nearly shipped: **`[ports]`
allocates positionally** (`base + index * stride`), so removing one member silently renumbered the
five services after it — `daemon_agent`, `model_router`, `arbiter`, `mcp` and `opencode_gateway`
each slid down a slot. A collapse of two Hermes keys had a blast radius of five unrelated services,
and no gate would have objected because the result was internally consistent. `[ports.categories]`
now accepts an **empty member as a reserved slot** that holds its index without naming a port, so a
retired service cannot renumber its neighbours. Every other port is byte-identical to before.

## Decision

### 1. A service's canonical address is the key its consumers already read, and offload is an overlay

**The overlay half is proven.** `tests/test-offload-overlay.py` writes an `/etc/mios` overlay,
resolves the SSOT in a child process exactly as a booted host does, and asserts that the named
services move to the remote blade, that the unnamed ones stay local, that an empty override never
wins (Law 1), and that **no file under `usr/` changes**. Sabotaging the host tier turns it red.
So `Network=host` plus the three-layer resolver really does make offload an addressing change.

**The prescription in this decision's first draft was wrong, and the measurement is why.** It said
every service gets a key in `[urls]` and consumers resolve `MIOS_URL_*`. Measured:

| Variable | Tracked files that read it |
|---|---|
| `MIOS_AI_ENDPOINT` (from `[ai].endpoint`) | **72** |
| `MIOS_AGENT_PIPE_BACKEND` | 7 |
| `MIOS_DB_URL` | 4 |
| `MIOS_LLM_CPU_ENDPOINT` | 3 |
| `MIOS_CRAWL_SERVICE_URL` | 3 |
| `MIOS_HERMES_ENDPOINT` | 1 |
| **every `MIOS_URLS_*`** (all 12 `[urls]` keys) | **0** |

Every `MIOS_URLS_*` variable is emitted and read by no shipped code, while a parallel set of
endpoint keys carries the real traffic. (`MIOS_URLS_FORGE` has exactly one hit, and it is sample
data in `tools/test_render_globals.py` — a fixture, not a consumer.) Migrating ~125 consumer files onto `MIOS_URL_*` would have stood up a
**second** canonical naming scheme beside the one that already works — the exact Law-9 violation
this ADR argues against everywhere else, committed in Law 9's name.

So the decision is inverted: **a service's canonical address is whichever single key its consumers
already resolve.** Offloading the AI plane today means overriding `[ai].endpoint`, and that works.
What `[urls]` is for is the *browser-openable* surface — portal tiles, `openInBrowser` labels, docs
— which is a different job from an inter-service endpoint, and it should either be scoped to that
job explicitly or retired.

What still holds, unchanged, is the enforcement: exactly one canonical name per service, and no
consumer hand-composing `localhost:${MIOS_PORT_*}` for itself. `check_service_urls` classifies
every port as addressed-or-registered so a new service cannot land without an answer, and
`check_ports_bound` catches the adjacent failure — a port allocated but bound by nothing.

This is Law 9 (one canonical name) applied to **addresses**, and it is required under *every*
answer to the naming question, which is why it is decided first and separately.

**`[urls]` is now scoped rather than proposed.** This decision said `[urls]` is "the browser-openable
surface … to be scoped to that job or retired". It is scoped: every entry must use an `http`/`https`
scheme, which is what *a person can open it* means, and `check_service_urls` fails anything else.
Four entries were inter-service addresses wearing a tile's clothes — `pgvector` was a
`postgresql://` DSN, and `llm_light`, `hermes` and `crawl_service` were `/v1` API bases. Each already
has exactly one canonical name its consumers resolve (`MIOS_DB_URL`, `MIOS_LLM_CPU_ENDPOINT`,
`MIOS_HERMES_ENDPOINT`, `MIOS_CRAWL_SERVICE_URL`), so a `[urls]` key for them was the second name
this decision exists to prevent. They move to the register, whose comment now names the only two
reasons an entry may appear there: the port serves no page, or its address is already stated
elsewhere. The register stops being debt and becomes a classification — which is what it always was.

### 2. A blade is a machine; a node is a lane on a blade

* A **blade** is a machine that serves addresses. `[blades.<name>]` becomes the machine registry:
  reachability (host or tailnet name), what it serves, and its capacity envelope.
* A **node** stays what `_load_node_pool()` already makes it — one canonical inference worker on
  one lane — and gains a `blade` field naming its host. `[nodes.*]` keys stop pretending to be
  machines (`local-dgpu` and `local-sglang` are the same box, the same port and the same model).
* A **seat** is a machine that runs the UX and consumes addresses. A seat may also be a blade.

The existing `health_gate = true` semantics — *auto-join when reachable, drop when gone* — become
the blade-level availability primitive rather than a per-node flag.

`[blades]` being empty today is not a gap to fill with the current node list; the current node list
is five aliases for one backend and must collapse before anything is built on it.

`[blades]` plural is the fleet axis and must stay orthogonal to `[blade]` singular, exactly as
BLADE-01's own acceptance criterion already requires (*"`[blades.*]`/`[nodes.*]` fleet-dispatch
(Axis B) stays orthogonal to `[blade]` OS-activation (Axis A)"*). The two keys differing by one
letter is a Law 9 hazard in waiting; if either is renamed, rename it for the axis it names.

### 3. Naming — MiOS-Mini is the seat; the hypervisor-router becomes MiOS-Metal

The requirement assigns the name: *MiOS-Mini is the image that offloads its services*. So **mini
names the seat**, and the hypervisor-router — which does the opposite, owning the metal and
hosting a full MiOS as a guest — is renamed **MiOS-Metal**.

The word was carrying five meanings, which is why this had to be resolved rather than left open:

| Claimant | Now |
|---|---|
| `[mini]` VFIO hypervisor-router | renamed `[metal]` / MiOS-Metal |
| `Containerfile.minimal` "MiOS-Lite" | deleted (Decision 4's lineage note) |
| The operator's offloading seat | **MiOS-Mini** |
| `MiOS-Mon.py --mini` compact dashboard | unrelated, untouched |
| `zz-mios-motd.sh` terminal "mini" view | unrelated, untouched |

> **CORRECTED (see Decision 9).** The paragraph below concluded that MiOS-Mini names the *seat*.
> That is wrong, and the operator has since said so plainly: **MiOS-Mini is the BOX** — a hardware
> appliance that owns NICs, radios, TPM and boot storage, and is built to be a Wi-Fi access point,
> a mesh/VPN router and a hyper-converged HA host for VMs and containers. The archetype names the
> **mode** that box boots into, seat mode being one of them. The `[mini]` → `[metal]` SSOT rename
> this decision performed is kept — `[metal]` correctly names the split-plane *hypervisor role* —
> but the naming conclusion is superseded.
>
> The evidence was in the tree the whole time: `usr/share/doc/mios/concepts/mios-metal-architecture.md:33`
> still draws the box as `MiOS-MINI`, running `hostapd · headscale · tailscaled · libvirt/KVM` and
> owning `NICs·radios·TPM·boot/root NVMe`. The rename updated the keys and filenames and left the
> diagram, so the original meaning survived intact next to the new claim contradicting it.

~~**MiOS-Mini is a product name for a role, not an image.** A MiOS-Mini is a machine running
`[blade].type = "endpoint"` — the seat archetype from Decision 4 — with an `/etc/mios` `[urls]`
overlay pointing at its blades.~~ It is the *same OCI image* as every other MiOS; nothing about it
is smaller at bake time (Law 3 BOUND-IMAGES still ships every Quadlet image with the host).

That is why the archetype key stays `endpoint` rather than becoming `mini`: `endpoint` is the
technical role name the role system already uses, and a second SSOT spelling for one concept is
the Law-9 violation this ADR keeps arguing against. Product name and SSOT key are different
registers, and only the SSOT key has to be unique.

The rename moved `[mini]`/`[mini.gpu]`/`[mini.mesh]` → `[metal]`, the three `[editions.*].mini.gpu`
overlays, the eleven `MIOS_MINI_*` resolver keys, `mios-mini-{vfio,mesh}-gen`, drift-check #68
(`check_mini_vfio` → `check_metal_vfio`) with its negative test, the names registry on both twins,
and `mios-mini-architecture.md` → `mios-metal-architecture.md`.

The lineage axis now has **one** member — the single root `Containerfile` — so nothing on that
axis competes for the name. `check_lint_is_final` globs `Containerfile*` rather than naming files,
and fails when the glob is empty, so a future lineage variant is covered the day it lands and a
tree with none cannot pass Law 4 vacuously.

### 4. One image, role by flag — already the mechanism; finish it on `[blade]`

Role is a **runtime** activation, not a bake-time fork, and this is not a proposal: `[blade].type`
→ capability markers → `ConditionPathExists` drop-ins is the WS-BLADE *"one image, role by flag"*
position and it ships. A seat is therefore **not a new image** — it is an archetype.

What this ADR decides is the three unfinished pieces, and that they land on `[blade]`, not beside
it. All three have now landed; what each turned out to be is recorded below, because two of them
were not what they looked like.

* **`[profile]` is gone, not aliased.** The plan was "alias onto `[blade]` for one release, then
  retire". Measurement made the alias pointless: `[profile].role = "developer"` was not a legal
  archetype, `role-apply` read `[blade].type` and never `[profile]`, `MIOS_PROFILE_ROLE` and
  `MIOS_PROFILE_FEATURES` were emitted by both `globals` twins and consumed by no shipped code —
  the resolver already classed the whole section `WALK_MOSTLY_DEAD` and resurrected exactly those
  two names through an explicit `WALK_EMIT_KEEP` exception — and the section's **only writer**,
  `user-setup.sh`, emitted `Role` with a capital `R`, which no reader spells that way. A key that
  is dead on both ends has nothing to alias. `[profile].features` had the same problem in a
  sharper form: its shipped values were `ai`, `virtualization`, `k3s`, and **none of them is a
  capability any archetype grants**. Retired outright; `check_role_ssot` fails a re-added
  `[profile].role` that is not a legal `[blade].type`, and fails either keep-list that names the
  retired vars again.

* **`05-mios-blade.toml` gets generated — and generating it broke three things.** The producer
  landed as specified (`tools/generate-blade-karg.py`, gate `check_blade_karg`). But the karg it
  emits is on **every** cmdline, and `role-apply` guarded its remaining tiers with
  `if [[ -z "$ROLE" ]]`. With the vendor karg always present, `ROLE` was never empty, so in one
  commit and with no error anywhere:
  `/etc/mios/role.conf` stopped being read (**`mios blade set` silently did nothing**), its
  `FEATURES=` stopped being read (**`mios blade add-capability` was erased on the next boot**,
  because `role-apply` clears `/etc/mios/blade.d` on every run), and the WSL / Blackwell / no-DRM
  hardware fallbacks became unreachable. This is the cost of a projection landing without the
  reader being re-read: the generator was correct in isolation and wrong in composition.

  The fix is a precedence **ladder** rather than a presence test, and it restores the same tier
  order the config overlay already uses — vendor(`/usr`) < host(`/etc`) < explicit:

  1. `mios.blade=` / `mios.role=` on the cmdline **that differs from `[blade].type`** — an
     operator changed it, so it wins;
  2. `ROLE=` in `/etc/mios/role.conf` — the host tier (Law 1);
  3. `[blade].type`, equivalently the generated karg — the vendor tier;
  4. the hardware sniff, which demotes **tier 3 only** to `[blade].fallback`: it corrects a role
     the vendor guessed and never overrules one a person chose.

  There is no fifth tier and **no archetype name anywhere in the blade code**. When the SSOT will
  not parse, `[blade].type` is empty, so any `mios.blade=` token differs from it and tier 1 claims
  it: the generated karg *is* the Law-12 floor. With neither, the resolver returns nothing rather
  than inventing an archetype. `tests/test-role-apply-precedence.sh` drives the real functions
  against fixtures; restoring the old presence test turns it red.

  Two smaller repairs fell out of the same reading. `role.conf` is now **parsed, not sourced** —
  `.` on a file under `/etc` runs it as root and clobbers whatever names it sets, which is how
  `FEATURES` used to vanish. And `mios.features=` used to `touch` any string into the capability
  namespace, so a typo created a marker nothing asks for and `mios.features=gpu-serving` was an
  undeclared escalation path; capability names are now the closed union of `[blade.archetypes]`,
  and `mios blade` refuses an unknown one with the legal set.

* **`role-apply` is demoted, but NOT to "starts nothing" — and that is a correction to this ADR.**
  The subtraction looked free and is not. Four of the six role targets are thin, and that sample
  produced the wrong generalisation: `mios-hybrid.target`, the **default**, carries
  `Requires=graphical.target` and `Wants=k3s-agent.service`, and `mios-desktop.target` requires
  `gdm.service` plus the libvirt stack. `automation/88-finalize.sh` bakes
  `set-default multi-user.target`, so on the **first** boot after install the role target is not
  reached by anything except `role-apply`'s `systemctl start`. Delete it and a fresh desktop
  install boots to a text console.

  Baking a role target instead was considered and rejected: it would put `Requires=graphical.target`
  on the boot-critical path of headless hardware, which fails worse and less visibly than a
  first-boot console. So `role-apply` keeps exactly one imperative act, and it is now
  **conditional**: `set-default` (declarative, decides the next boot, starts nothing) always; a
  `systemctl start` only when the resolved target differs from the one recorded in
  `/var/lib/mios/role.active`. Steady-state boots take neither branch — the markers alone decide
  what runs — so the "two racing schedulers" this bullet was written about are gone, without
  trading them for a broken first boot.

* **The role targets did not form a switchable set.** Day-2 switching depends on `Conflicts=`,
  since the new target is started rather than isolated. The graph shipped incomplete and the
  **default archetype conflicted with nothing at all**, so `mios blade set headless` on a hybrid
  blade started headless and left hybrid running. `[blade.archetypes]` and the shipped targets are
  now a complete pairwise graph, gated. Separately, `mios-hybrid.target` and `mios-k3s-worker.target`
  each declared `Alias=default.target.mios-<role>` — an alias must carry its unit's own suffix, so
  systemd can never install it, and because that alias *was* their entire `[Install]` section the
  default role target had no `WantedBy=` while all seven peers did.

* **Two roles selected a target while granting no capabilities.** `role-apply` matched `k3s*` and
  `ha*` as case globs, so `mios.blade=k3s` set `mios-k3s-master.target` and then resolved to `[]`
  capabilities — the target came up and the entire service plane stayed condition-skipped. Both
  are now declared archetypes, and the two legacy spellings are **data** in `[blade.role_aliases]`
  rather than globs, so `k3sx` no longer selects anything.

**A seat is `[blade.archetypes].endpoint`** — no new name for a thing the tree already had. An
archetype with **no capabilities is a seat**, because a blade activates a unit only when its
`ConditionPathExists=/etc/mios/blade.d/<cap>` marker is present.

**The taxonomy is the requirement's own words: a seat offloads *all* services.** So every declared
container requires the `service-plane` capability, which every archetype grants **except**
`endpoint`. The GPU lanes additionally require `gpu-serving` — repeated `ConditionPathExists` is an
AND, so a lane needs both markers.

| Archetype | Capabilities | Containers it activates (of 23) |
|---|---|---|
| `hybrid` (default) | `gpu-serving`, `controller`, `service-plane` | 23 |
| `compute` | `gpu-serving`, `service-plane` | 23 |
| `controller` | `controller`, `service-plane` | 20 |
| `headless` | `service-plane` | 20 |
| `desktop` | `service-plane` | 20 |
| `k3s-master` | `controller`, `service-plane` | 20 |
| `ha-node` | `controller`, `service-plane` | 20 |
| **`endpoint`** — the seat | *(none)* | **0** |

Only the seat's behaviour changes: every other archetype activates exactly what it did before,
because the three GPU lanes were already skipped wherever `gpu-serving` was absent.

**"Offload all services" cannot mean "start nothing."** The containers were half the plane: 18
long-running native `.service` units shipped ungated, so a seat started every one of them, and the
coverage gate's own "23 of 23" was reported over a set that excluded them. Those 18 split on the
seat/serving line this ADR already draws — *a seat runs the UX and consumes addresses*:

* **Gated off on a seat** (serving): `hermes-worker`, `k3s`, `mios-account-sync`, `mios-agents`,
  `mios-cron-director`, `mios-daemon`, `mios-finetune-serve`, `mios-mcp`, `mios-opencode-gateway`,
  `mios-policy-arbiter`.
* **`[blade].seat_side`** — a *positive* declaration, not debt: `mios-agent-pipe` (the local front
  door whose `MIOS_AI_ENDPOINT` points at the blade), `hermes-dashboard`, the two CDP browsers,
  `mios-hermes-tail`, and the two `ttyd` bridges. A seat with no agent-pipe has no way to reach its
  blade at all.

The gate now classifies **40 units** — containers and native units share one namespace, since a
Quadlet named `x` generates `x.service` — into exactly one of gated / seat-side / ungated-debt.
`tests/test-seat-activates-nothing.py` is the executable definition and runs in CI; returning one
container *or one native unit* to ungated turns it red.

**Hand-classification is not enough, and one derived rule proves it.** A unit that *activates* a
gated unit must carry that unit's capabilities, or it starts on a blade where its dependency is
condition-skipped and fails forever. Applied to the tree, that found **11 units nobody had
classified** — `mios-pgvector-backup`, `mios-embed-backfill`, `mios-skills-miner`,
`mios-userdb-render`, `mios-sys-env-refresh`, `mios-passport-provision`, the three forge
provisioners, `mios-k3s-master.target`, and `hermes-worker`. On a seat those timers would fire
forever against a database the machine does not run.

Two distinctions make the rule correct rather than merely strict. `After=` is ordering and
activates nothing, so it never propagates a gate. And a *soft* pull on a gated unit is acceptable
when the puller genuinely degrades — `hermes-worker` `Wants=` both lanes and falls back to the
light one — so `[blade].soft_ok` records that as a deliberate exemption instead of over-gating it
off three archetypes where it works today.

This is also why "must be classified" and "may be gated" are different sets: a oneshot needs no
classification of its own, but may legitimately be gated because of what it activates. Ten units
are gated for exactly that reason.

#### The line itself: a seat runs I/O, a blade runs compute and state

The `seat_side` list was assembled unit by unit, which left the *rule* implicit — and an implicit
rule cannot be checked. Stated: **a seat runs what the person touches; a blade runs what the work
needs.** Everything that survives on a seat is local I/O — the front door every client dials
(`mios-agent-pipe`), the browser the person watches (`mios-hermes-browser`), the UI
(`hermes-dashboard`), the journal view (`mios-hermes-tail`), and two ptys. Everything gated is
compute or state — inference, database, search, crawl, workers, cluster.

That rule settles the case that exposed it. **`mios-hermes-browser-worker` was seat-side and should
never have been:** it is not the person's browser, it is a second headless Chrome on `profile-w2`
whose only client is `hermes-worker`, which a seat does not run. A seat was starting a browser for a
worker it did not have. It is now gated with its consumer, which changes **only** the seat — every
other archetype keeps it.

The rule is mechanical, and the mechanism is why it was missed. **The AI plane couples over
ADDRESSES, not unit dependencies**, so the `Requires=`/`Wants=` walk that found the eleven
dependency violations structurally could not see this one: `hermes-worker` reaches the browser
through `BROWSER_CDP_URL`, and systemd has no idea. `check_blade_coverage` now also reads the port
graph: a seat-side unit that binds a port whose every *other* namer is capability-gated serves
nothing on a seat and fails the gate. The exemption is derived, not declared — a port is
person-facing when it has a browser-openable `[urls]` entry or is the one `[ai].endpoint` resolves,
which is exactly why `mios-agent-pipe` is legitimate seat-side while the worker browser is not.

#### Two roles the archetype table had not been asked about

**CDP stays local, permanently, and that is not a limitation.** The primary browser's binder is
`usr/share/mios/flatpak-flags/com.google.ChromeDev.flags`, a static flatpak argument file that
cannot template a placeholder — so `chrome_cdp` is pinned at 9222 rather than derived into the 8xxx
band. Under the I/O-versus-compute line that is correct rather than merely unavoidable: the browser
is a *device*, like the display and the keyboard. A seat offloads compute and state; it does not
offload the screen it is looking at.

**`mios-k3s` runs `k3s server` — a cluster control plane — and now requires `controller`.** The
default is unchanged: `[blade].type = "hybrid"` grants `controller`, as do `controller`,
`k3s-master` and `ha-node`. What changes is that an explicitly-chosen `compute`, `desktop` or
`headless` blade stops running a Kubernetes control plane, which is the plain meaning of those
names — `hybrid`'s own target wants `k3s-agent.service`, the *agent*, not the server. This is the
last consumer the `controller` capability needed: it was granted by four archetypes and required by
nothing, so a `controller` blade behaved exactly like a `headless` one.

A seat therefore costs one archetype plus the overlay from Decision 1. No new Containerfile, no new
axis, and — measured — **no service.**

Lineage stays a **bake-time** fork, because it is one — a different `FROM`.

The two must not be conflated again: a role must never require its own Containerfile, and a lineage
must never imply a role.

### 5. A seat's front door is off-box by design, so the seat is where auth stops being optional

Decision 1 makes offload an overlay: the seat repoints `[ai].endpoint` and the canonical key its
consumers already read. The `[ai]` header said the opposite — *"endpoint MUST stay on localhost;
vendor cloud URLs are forbidden by audit (postcheck #12 enforces this in the active config)"* — and
**there is no postcheck #12**; nothing in the tree enforced it. A rule guarded by a citation to a
check that does not exist is the `[profile].role` failure again, and here it directly contradicted
the topology.

The rule, restated so it is both true and enforceable:

* The **vendor** default stays local. `usr/share/mios/mios.toml` never ships an off-box endpoint,
  and never a vendor cloud URL — that half of Law 5 is real and is now checkable.
* An **operator overlay** may point the endpoint anywhere. That is the whole mechanism; local,
  localhost and remote are three values of it.
* An off-box endpoint means the request leaves the machine, so **`[security].api_require_auth` is
  the seat's precondition, not a preference.**

That last clause was unstatable until T-325: `api_require_auth` and `principal_bind_mode` had been
orphaned under an unclosed `[security.nohc_allowlist]` header, and both consumers read
`[security].<key>`, so both always took their compiled default. **The controls that bound a seat
could not be switched on.** They are reachable now; the defaults are unchanged (`false` and `off`),
because turning them on is an operator decision about front-door posture.

The tenancy question is what makes this a seat-specific decision rather than general hygiene. A
fully hosted MiOS is one machine, loopback, one human — an ungated front door costs little. A seat
inverts every term: the endpoint is off-box, N seats share one blade, and `owner_user`, the
row-scope on the shared pgvector memory, is derived from the request body's `user` field plus
forwarded headers, both settable by any direct caller. `principal_bind_mode = enforce` is what binds
that owner to an authenticated key. **It is the seat topology's only tenancy boundary.**

### 6. A seat has no local inference floor, and that is the definition rather than a gap

Every lane — heavy, alt, light, and the CPU node — is capability-gated off on `endpoint`, including
the one the resolver calls the always-on floor. When the blade is unreachable, a seat has a front
door that reaches nothing.

That is kept, because "offload *all* services" is the requirement and a floor would contradict it.
What is added is an **opt-in**, so the choice is the operator's rather than the archetype's: a
`seat-floor` capability, granted by no archetype, that ungates exactly one micro lane. `lfm2-700m`
is already baked and CPU-only, so the cost when it is off is zero and the cost when it is on is one
small model. A seat that wants degraded-but-alive grants it in `/etc/mios/role.conf`; a seat that
wants the pure definition does nothing.

The failure must also be *legible*, which is the half that was missing: a seat whose blade is gone
should say "blade unreachable", not surface a model error. The detection exists; wiring it to the
dashboard is what remains.

### 7. One image, always. The seat pays blade-sized disk and that is the correct trade

A seat carries every baked payload it will never load, including the vLLM AWQ snapshot (~16 GB by
the SSOT's own figure) and the GGUF set. Splitting the image would end that, and is refused: one
rebuildable image is the whole `bootc` premise, a second tag doubles the CVE surface for what is a
*runtime* difference, and Law 12 exists precisely so first boot never depends on egress.

Two corrections follow rather than a split. The cost must be **visible** — the baked-weight byte
count belongs in the generated comparison, so "a seat carries N GB it never loads" is a number an
operator can weigh. And `[ai.vllm].bake_model` is baked by default while `[ai.vllm].enable = false`,
which is not Law 12 discipline but an unreviewed default; the payload, not the image, is what should
become opt-in there.

### 8. A seat is stateless by definition, and skew between seat and blade must be visible

Memory, sessions, skills and events live on the blade. A seat keeps nothing, which is the honest
reading of "offload all services" and is hereby the contract rather than an accident.

Two consequences the tree did not express. `[greenboot].blade_reachability_critical = false` is
right — a seat must not roll itself back over someone else's outage — but it meant a seat's greenboot
could only ever fail on `mios-agent-pipe`, and the key itself was read by nothing: its only consumer
was the generator that *described* it. Blade reachability is now **recorded on every boot** and
becomes critical only when that flag says so (T-329). And nothing anywhere expresses a compatibility floor: seat and
blade `bootc upgrade` independently, and a seat two releases ahead of its blade fails
mysteriously. `[blade].min_peer_version`, reported by the reachability probe and **non-fatal**, is
the smallest thing that makes that legible.

### 9. MiOS-Mini is the full image on a box, and "offload" means SHED, not thin

Two earlier revisions of this decision were wrong in opposite directions, and both shipped. The
first said MiOS-Mini names the thin seat. The second corrected that to "Mini is the box, the
archetype is the mode" — right about the box, still wrong about what Mini *does*. The operator's
definition, stated directly:

> *"Mini does run the AI plane. Mini is the full image. It just scales everything to the hosted
> containers, booted images to run the services. Mini is the fallback that moves the services
> across the mesh to other blades and nodes. It boots the entire image. It's all hosted as its own
> cluster."*

**MiOS-Mini is a complete, self-sufficient node.** It boots the entire image, runs the AI plane
itself, and is its own cluster. It is not a client of anything.

**"Offload all services to hosted MiOS OCI image(s)" describes a capability, not a deficit.** A Mini
can push any service out to peer images across the mesh — to scale, to rebalance, or to fail over.
That is exactly ADR-0017's workload mobility (*"everything can migrate anywhere and is always
load-balancing services, containers and VMs among blades across the entire cluster/mesh"*), read
from the Mini's side. The original requirement sentence was never describing a thin client; it was
describing a node that can empty itself onto its peers.

That distinction is the whole design, and getting it backwards produced a session's worth of work
reasoned from a thin seat that does not exist as a product.

#### What a Mini is, concretely

| Facet | The operator's answer |
|---|---|
| **Network role** | serves clients **and** is the uplink — *"an access point and a router all at once"* |
| **Mesh** | **Tailscale is the current implementation; Headscale is the target.** `[metal.mesh].headscale_domain` is therefore a target key, not a live one |
| **Hyper-converged** | every service can be a mesh member, a Kubernetes workload, a CephFS participant, and/or under Cockpit's high availability — *all of these at once*, not a choice between them |
| **AI plane** | **runs on the Mini.** Not confined to a guest |
| **Cluster** | *"It's all hosted as its own cluster"* — a single Mini is a complete cluster, and peers join it |

The `endpoint` archetype remains real and remains useful — a node granting no capabilities, running
6 units. But it is a **posture a node can take**, not what MiOS-Mini is. Nothing should call it
"MiOS-Mini" again.

#### What this invalidates

* **The AP is both halves.** Serving clients *and* being the uplink means at least two radios, or a
  wired WAN plus one radio. A single-radio design cannot do both, so the hardware floor is a
  constraint on the product, not an implementation detail.
* **`[metal.mesh]` names the target, not the present.** Tailscale being the live implementation and
  headscale the goal means the SSOT currently declares only the destination. The live path is
  unrepresented, which is why the audit found "no mesh transport" — it was looking for the target.
* **Hyper-convergence is a union, not a menu.** A service is expected to be simultaneously
  addressable on the mesh, schedulable by Kubernetes, storable on CephFS and HA-managed. Any one of
  those being single-node caps all of them.

### 10. The two products differ by what metal they own, and only an `either` plane can be shed

Decision 9 settled what a MiOS-Mini *is*. It did not settle the comparison the requirement actually
asks for: **MiOS-Mini against the fully hosted, feature-complete MiOS OCI image(s) it sheds to.**
Without that line drawn, "offload all services" has no boundary — it reads as though every plane
were movable, which would make a Mini indistinguishable from a container.

**They are one artifact.** Same image, same tag, same bake — a hosted instance is the identical OCI
image in a different *position*: a container, a VM, or another machine, local or remote. There is no
Mini build and no hosted build, and there must never be one; that is Decision 7 applied at the
product level rather than the archetype level.

**They differ by what they own, not by what they contain.** A Mini owns metal a guest does not
have: radios, the uplink NIC, the hypervisor itself, a vote in the cluster. `[blade.planes].owner`
is that line, and it has exactly two values:

| `owner` | Meaning | Can be shed |
|---|---|---|
| `mini` | The plane owns metal this box has and a guest does not. | **No** — a hosted image has nothing to shed it *onto*. |
| `either` | The plane is a workload. A Mini runs it by default and may hand it to any peer. | **Yes** |

**This is the definition of offload, and it is narrower than the requirement sentence suggests.**
Of the eight declared planes, three are `either` — `ai`, `orchestrator`, `storage`. The other five —
`ha`, `hypervisor`, `mesh`, `radio`, `router` — are what make the box a Mini, and a Mini that shed
them would stop being one. So "offload *all* services" is true of services and false of planes:
every *service* is movable because every service rides `ai`/`orchestrator`/`storage`; the planes
underneath them are the box.

The alternative — letting a hosted image own a `mini` plane — was rejected because it is not a
policy choice but a physical one. A container has no radio to serve clients with and no NIC to be
an uplink on; declaring it eligible would produce a placement the scheduler could satisfy and the
hardware could not.

**Neither tier is derived from a hand-written verdict.** `markers` names the packages whose presence
in `[packages]` proves the plane is baked (Law 12), and `wired_by` names the file that activates it;
`tools/generate-mini-vs-hosted.py` derives both and `--check` gates the result, so the comparison
cannot go stale and nobody can write "built" into the SSOT (Law 8).

#### What the derivation currently reports

Read narrowly: *baked* means the marker packages ship, and *wired* means the named file exists.
Neither claims a plane is finished — `router` is baked and forwards, and still has no NAT ruleset or
client DHCP (T-337).

Two planes fail outright, and **both are `owner = "mini"`**:

* `radio` — `hostapd` and `wpa_supplicant` are absent from `[packages]`, and nothing wires an AP.
* `mesh` — `tailscale` is absent; only a repo URL ships. Fetching it at first boot would violate
  Law 12.

That is the finding this decision exists to make visible: **the planes a hosted image was never
going to provide are precisely the ones the Mini does not have yet.** The gap between the two
products is not that hosted instances are missing capability — it is that the Mini-only tier is the
least built tier in the tree, and it is the only tier that cannot be filled by adding a peer.


### 11. Four axes the operator settled, and what each one costs

Decision 10 drew the ownership line and left five axes open. Four are answered here. Each changes
what gets built, so each is recorded with the price it carries rather than as a preference.

#### 11.1 The hardware floor is **interfaces**, not radios

> *"1 radio + 1 WAN, 2 radios and/or any amount of either as long as it combines to 2 separate
> interfaces."*

`[blade.hardware].min_interfaces = 2`, `min_ap_capable = 1`. Serving clients **and** being the uplink
needs two separate interfaces; any mix satisfies it — one radio plus a wired WAN, two radios, or
more. At least one must be able to run as an access point.

This is a better constraint than a radio count, because it is the one that is actually true: the
`radio` and `router` planes need *separation*, not *wirelessness*. It also widens the hardware
envelope considerably — a mini-PC with an ethernet port and one WiFi card qualifies.

The cost is that the floor is now checkable at runtime and nothing checks it. A box with one
interface can still resolve an archetype that grants both planes, and will simply fail to be an
uplink and an AP at once. A gate has to enforce this or it is documentation.

#### 11.2 A guest may hold a vote, so `ha` moves to `either`

`[blade.planes.ha].owner` was `mini` on the reasoning that fencing needs a real machine to power-cycle.
The operator's answer overrides that: a hosted MiOS image may be a cluster member.

What this buys is an odd quorum on two physical boxes — the common small-fleet case — without
buying a third box. `corosync-qdevice` and `corosync-qnetd` are already in `[packages]`, so the
mechanism ships.

**The cost is that fencing a guest goes via its host, which is a strictly weaker guarantee.** If the
host is the thing that failed, the fence cannot be confirmed, and an unconfirmable fence is how
Pacemaker deadlocks rather than corrupts — it will refuse to recover the resource. `pacemaker-unfenced`
therefore stops being a one-node concession and becomes a real design item: STONITH must be
configured with a fencing path per member *kind*, not one path for all members.

#### 11.3 Peer #2 **joins**; it does not federate

> One cluster, one elected server. Later boxes join it.

This settles the `k3s-multi-server` hazard's *shape*: the defect is not that the unit runs
`k3s server`, it is that it runs it unconditionally. The fix is an election — first box up is the
server, every later box resolves `K3S_URL` to it and starts as an agent — not a second control plane.

The cost is that a join-based cluster has a single control plane to lose. At three or more boxes the
k3s-native answer is an HA control plane (embedded etcd across three servers), which means the
election is not "one server forever" but "one server until there are three". That threshold has to be
declared in SSOT alongside `[blades].typical_nodes`, or the fleet grows into a split-brain instead of
into quorum.

#### 11.4 CephFS shadow-copies across the mesh, so a shed workload is never cold

> *"CephFS has shadow-copies across the mesh (local, localhost and remote)."*

This was not one of the three options offered, and it is a better answer than any of them. The
question assumed the peer either has the data or does not, making CephFS a *precondition* of
accepting work. Replication removes the question: the data is already wherever the workload lands,
so a shed is warm by construction and placement never has to check for a mount.

It also makes `storage` structurally different from the other two `either` planes. `ai` and
`orchestrator` are shed *to* one peer; `storage` is present on *all* of them. It is a movable plane
that is never actually moved — only extended.

**Two costs, both real.** First, "remote" in that sentence means data at rest on a machine outside the
site, which collides with `[security.redact]` on the persist path and with the `config_kv`
conflict-is-error rule in ADR-0017 D5 — a shadow copy that diverges during a partition is exactly the
case that ADR says an operator must resolve. Second, replication is not free: every write costs
bandwidth on the mesh, and the mesh plane is the one that is not baked yet (D10). CephFS
shadow-copies over a link that does not exist is the ordering problem to solve first.


### 12. The four consequences of D11, settled — and the two tensions they leave

D11's answers each weakened a guarantee to buy a capability. These four decide how each weakened
guarantee is held. Two of them create a tension with a decision already taken, and both are recorded
here rather than resolved silently.

#### 12.1 Every member self-fences; no member has to be reached

`[blade.fencing].method = "sbd"`, `diskless = true`.

D11.2 let a guest hold a vote, which made fencing the open question: fencing a guest via its host
fails exactly when the host is what failed. SBD removes the question rather than answering it —
each member runs a watchdog and self-fences on quorum loss, so **no member ever has to be reached to
be fenced.** That is what makes a guest vote safe, and it is a stronger guarantee than the metal-only
posture D11.2 replaced, not a weaker one.

Diskless mode drives the watchdog from quorum alone, so no shared block device is needed — which
matters because the shared filesystem is CephFS, and making the fence depend on the storage plane
would couple two failure domains that should stay separate.

`sbd` and `fence-agents-all` are already in `[packages]`. The plane is baked; what is missing is the
watchdog device in each guest (libvirt must expose one, or `softdog` must be permitted) and the
`stonith-enabled=true` that `pacemaker-unfenced` currently holds off.

#### 12.2 One control plane, always — containers outlive it

`[blade.cluster].k3s_servers = 1`, `control_plane_ha = false`.

No promotion threshold and no election race. This is deliberately simpler than the k3s-native
"embedded etcd at three servers" path, and it is defensible for one specific reason: **when the k3s
server is down, containers keep running.** Only *scheduling* stops. A 2–6 box fleet that loses its
control plane degrades to "nothing new starts", not "everything stops".

It also makes the `k3s-multi-server` hazard's fix concrete and small: exactly one box runs
`k3s server`; every other box resolves `K3S_URL` to it and starts as an agent. `[blade.cluster].server`
is empty by default, meaning the first Mini installed, and may be set to pin a specific box.

The cost is stated plainly: containers are best-effort across a control-plane outage while VMs are
genuinely HA under Pacemaker. That asymmetry is a real property of this design, and callers should
not be told the two workload kinds have equal availability.

#### 12.3 Encrypt at rest and replicate everything — and the key question is open

`[blade.storage].replication = "all"`, `at_rest = "encrypted"`.

No per-class filter: `knowledge`, `agent_memory`, `session` and `config_kv` all shadow-copy.
Confidentiality comes from encryption rather than from withholding classes, which keeps D11.4's
promise that a shed workload is never cold for *any* data class.

**The tension.** `[security].disk_encryption` is TPM2-sealed to PCR 7 of one box, so it cannot travel
with a shadow copy. A remote shadow needs a different key, and which one decides what the encryption
actually buys:

* If **every mesh member holds the site key**, the remote peer can read the copy — so a shed there is
  warm, D11.4 holds, and encryption protects against physical theft of the remote box but **not**
  against whoever operates it.
* If **the remote peer does not hold the key**, it stores ciphertext it cannot use — so a shed to
  that peer is **cold for stateful workloads**, which contradicts D11.4.

Those are the only two options and they are mutually exclusive. This is recorded as unsettled
(T-338 axis 6) because picking one silently would quietly reverse either D11.4 or the threat model.

#### 12.4 The default route moves; the router plane does not

`[blade.uplink].failover = "peer"`.

`router` is `owner = "mini"` and stays put. When the WAN dies the Mini keeps serving its clients and
keeps routing them — what moves is the **default route**, handed to a peer with a live uplink. This
introduces a third movable category alongside plane and workload: a *route* is neither, and it needs
its own declaration, which is why it is not modelled as `owner` on a plane.

Deliberately **not** `[security].egress`, which is an allowlist and a different concept; naming this
one `egress` would have collided two unrelated mechanisms on one word.

**The tension.** ADR-0017 D3 makes local-first the house failover ordering: retry in place, then let
the cluster allocate. `failover = "peer"` skips the local step even though `[blade.hardware]`
guarantees a second interface that might itself have an uplink. Either the second interface should be
tried first (making this `["local", "peer"]` and consistent with D3), or uplink failover is a
deliberate exception to D3 because a dead WAN is not a crashed process and retrying in place is
usually pointless. That is T-338 axis 7.

This also depends on the plane that is not baked: handing a default route to a peer is a mesh
operation (a Tailscale exit node, in the current implementation), and `mesh` has no package and no
wiring. Ordering matters — the uplink failover cannot be built before the mesh is.


### 13. Research findings that closed two directives

D12 left two axes to research rather than choose. Both had answers upstream constraints *forced*.

#### 13.1 A TPM2 PCR policy cannot travel, so a portable drive enrolls a second token

The operator's constraint: whatever is chosen must run off a **MiOS-Cat** USB/NVMe drive natively,
under Microsoft Secure Boot, with MOK for NVIDIA and other proprietary drivers.

That constraint *decides* the question rather than narrowing it:

* **PCR 7 measures the host's Secure Boot state.** A different machine has different certificates in
  its `db`, so PCR 7 differs. Adding PCRs makes it worse — operators report re-prompts after changes
  as small as a different monitor.
* **PCR 14 measures MOK enrolment**, which is exactly what `akmods`-built NVIDIA modules need under
  Secure Boot. MOK lives in *that machine's* UEFI variables, so PCR 14 is per-machine by
  construction.

**Both PCRs a MiOS-Cat drive would need are host-bound. A TPM2-sealed key cannot travel — that is a
property of the measurement, not a misconfiguration.**

`[security.disk_encryption].pcrs` moves to `[7, 14]`, which is what a MOK-signing host actually
requires and which the tree had wrong at `[7]`. The portable case gets a **second enrolled token**
rather than a different policy: `portable_token = "fido2"`. `systemd-cryptenroll` allows several
tokens on one LUKS2 volume, so one image is TPM2-unattended on a fixed Mini and FIDO2-unlocked on
any machine the drive is carried to. FIDO2 over PKCS#11 because the secret never leaves the device
and no key-provisioning ceremony is needed.

**Consequence for the whole namespace:** `[security].luks` and `[security].disk_encryption` have **no
consumers in the tree**. The scheme this picks is not "changed", it is unimplemented, and the first
build step is a consumer rather than a tune.

#### 13.2 hostapd, because 6 GHz is a protocol requirement — and the driver decides more than the daemon

The operator asked for the most compatible and performant option across every MiOS variant. The
candidates are not equivalent:

* **hostapd** carries 802.11ax since 2.10 and full WPA3-SAE with management-frame protection, which
  6 GHz **requires** rather than merely supports.
* **iwd** AP mode is reported to cap at 802.11n and 20 MHz — disqualifying on the "performant" half.
* **NetworkManager** AP mode does support WPA3-SAE and auto-configures `dnsmasq` for client DHCP/DNS,
  but has no documented 802.11ax/6 GHz support. It is the convenient path, not the compatible one.

**The caveat matters more than the choice.** Intel's `iwlwifi` has good AP support only on 2.4 GHz —
5 GHz AP is disabled or crippled — while Atheros (`ath9k`/`ath1xk`) and MediaTek (`mt76`) are the
capable AP chipsets. **No daemon fixes a chipset that will not beacon.** A chipset floor is therefore
a separate constraint from the interface floor, and nothing in the tree expresses one yet.

`NetworkManager-wifi` stays where it is: it is the desktop *client*, unrelated to the AP plane.

### 14. The operator's corrections — MiOS runs anywhere, and CephFS never travels

Four of the operator's answers correct decisions taken above. Two reverse them outright, and both
reversals are right for reasons the earlier decisions had not weighed.

#### 14.1 MiOS boots on ANY hardware; radio count is one or none

> *"Radio count will be one or none. Use LAN as uplink and downlink. MiOS is meant to run on any
> hardware no matter radio count or otherwise."*

**This reverses D11.1.** That decision read a two-interface answer as a *hardware floor on the
product*, and a floor is exactly what MiOS must not have — an immutable image whose reason to exist
is running anywhere cannot refuse to boot for want of a second NIC.

`[blade.hardware]` becomes `min_interfaces = 1`, `max_radios = 1`, `min_ap_capable = 0`. The LAN is
both uplink and downlink, so one interface is the whole floor. These numbers now gate a **plane**,
never the boot: a box that misses one still boots and simply does not run that plane, which is
Law 12's degrade-open applied to hardware.

That makes `radio` the one **optional** `mini` plane, and motivates a third field beside `owner`:
`required` — *a Mini must run this itself*. A Mini with no radio is still a Mini; one without a
hypervisor, a router, a mesh or CephFS is not.

#### 14.2 CephFS is a native Mini service on bare metal, and never travels

> *"CephFS stays on the mini bare metal. Never travels to a transient OCI image. CephFS is a native
> service, part of the mini platform."*

**This reverses D11.4 and most of D12.3.** `[blade.planes.storage].owner` moves `either` → `mini`,
`required = true`.

The reasoning that made it `either` was that a shed workload needs its data wherever it lands. That
is true and it is not an argument for making the *filesystem* movable — it is an argument for
replication, which D11.4 already supplied. Storage was the odd plane in the movable set precisely
because it is *present on all peers rather than shed to one*; declaring it `mini` names that
correctly instead of describing it as a movable plane that never moves.

It also **dissolves the open key question of D12.3**. That tension existed only because a shadow copy
might land on a transient, possibly off-site OCI image whose operator is not the owner. Replication
is now Mini-to-Mini, between machines the operator owns, so encryption at rest protects a drive
rather than arbitrating a trust boundary — and the MiOS-Cat answer in D13.1 covers exactly that.

The shed set is therefore **3 of 8**: `ai`, `ha`, `orchestrator`.

#### 14.3 The mesh is the LAN; Tailscale is the fallback and never blocks boot

> *"It'll just use mesh topology. I have a Tailscale account. Use LAN. Tailscale is secondary
> fallback … at enrolment, without blocking the boot."*

**This supersedes D13.2's WireGuard default.** That decision optimised for "minimal licensed
dependencies" and reached for kernel WireGuard — correct on licensing, wrong on the simpler fact
that **a single site needs no overlay at all.** The LAN is the primary transport, and the tree
already bakes what it needs (`avahi`, `nss-mdns`); Tailscale is the declared fallback for when the
LAN cannot reach.

This also matches `[blade.discovery].order` — `localhost → mdns → tailnet → remote` — which the tree
has carried since D1. The mesh decision was already made there; D13.2 introduced a transport neither
that order nor the operator had asked for.

`[blade.mesh].blocks_boot = false` states Law 12 where it will be read: mesh enrolment never gates a
boot.

#### 14.4 A Mini is its own cluster by serving itself as three logical hosts

> *"Its own cluster, meaning it can host all its services as if it was three separate individual
> hosts, all on localhost."*

`[blade.cluster].localhost_hosts = 3`. This is what "a single Mini is a complete cluster" (D9) means
operationally, and it is a much stronger claim than "it runs everything": the Mini exercises the same
three-member topology a fleet would, on one box, so quorum, fencing and placement are the *same code
paths* whether or not a peer exists. A fleet of one is not a special case.

`[blade.mesh].federate = "manual"`: a second Mini builds its own localhost cluster first, federates
itself over the mesh, and is then synced by hand.

**This is in tension with D11.3**, which settled that peer #2 *joins* one elected k3s server. The two
can both hold if they describe different layers — k3s joining *within* a box's logical hosts, boxes
*federating* across the mesh — but which layer owns cross-box container placement is not settled by
either answer, and is recorded as open rather than guessed (T-338 axis 11).

#### 14.5 Management packages: already baked, bar one

> *"Cockpit high availability should have Cockpit machines, pacemaker, everything … as a package or
> dependency in the MiOS SSOT packages section."*

Checked rather than assumed: `cockpit-machines`, `cockpit-podman`, `cockpit-ostree`,
`cockpit-selinux`, `cockpit-storaged`, `cockpit-networkmanager`, `cockpit-files`, `cockpit-sosreport`
and the full PCP stack are already in `[packages.cockpit]`; `pacemaker`, `corosync`, `pcs`, `sbd`,
`fence-agents-all`, `fence-virt`, `dlm`, `booth`, `corosync-qdevice` and `corosync-qnetd` are already
in `[packages.ha]`.

One package was genuinely missing and is added: **`pcs-web-ui`**, the HA cluster web UI Cockpit
fronts. Without it the HA stack ships with no management surface, which is precisely the gap the
requirement names.


### 15. Native patterns everywhere — and the reconciliation that makes a fleet of one ordinary

> *"Automatic syncing and native patterns for high availabilities and Kubernetes."*
> *"Native patterns for this; research thoroughly."*

The governing rule these three answers share: **every cross-box mechanism is the upstream project's
own, never a MiOS invention.** A hand-rolled equivalent of something k3s, Corosync or Ceph already
does is the defect, not the feature.

#### 15.1 `ha` is a native platform service, like CephFS

`[blade.planes.ha].owner` moves `either` → `mini`. D11.2 had allowed a guest to hold a vote; the
operator's later answer — that CephFS and the management services are *native to the platform* —
pulls Pacemaker/Corosync back to bare metal with it.

**The shed set is now 2 of 8: `ai` and `orchestrator`.** That is the clean statement of what MiOS-Mini
is: **every platform and management plane is bare metal, and only the workload planes move.** The
earlier sets (4, then 3) were mid-refinement; this one has a principle behind it rather than a
tally.

D12.1's SBD self-fencing is unaffected and remains right for a different reason than it was chosen:
it was picked to make a *guest* vote safe, and it survives because self-fencing is the native
Corosync answer regardless of what a member runs on.

#### 15.2 k3s-native HA is three servers — and a Mini already has three hosts

`[blade.cluster]`: `k3s_servers = 3`, `control_plane_ha = true`.

**This supersedes D12.2's "one control plane, always."** The native k3s HA pattern is three servers
on embedded etcd, tolerating one loss; "native patterns for Kubernetes" names that directly, and a
single server has no cross-box HA story at all.

**The reconciliation is the interesting part.** D14.4 set `localhost_hosts = 3` — a Mini serves
itself as three logical hosts. Those three hosts **are** the three etcd members. So the native
three-server quorum runs *on one box*, which is what makes D9's claim ("a single Mini is a complete
cluster") literally true rather than aspirational: quorum, fencing and placement are not simulated
on a lone Mini, they are the real thing at minimum size. A fleet of one stops being a special case,
and additional Minis are additive rather than transformative.

That also retires the "which layer places a cross-box container" question of D14.4 without needing a
new arbiter: `[blade.placement]` already says containers → k3s and VMs → Pacemaker, and both now
span boxes by their own membership mechanisms. `[blade.mesh].federate = "native"` records that peers
join through those mechanisms automatically — **not** the manual sync D14.4 provisionally assumed.

#### 15.3 Ceph's own encryption, which is a different mechanism from the drive's

`[blade.storage].at_rest = "dmcrypt"`.

Ceph encrypts OSDs with dm-crypt, generating the key at OSD creation and storing it in the
**monitor config-key store**; the OSD retrieves it from the MONs at startup. That is a complete,
native key-management story with no external key manager, and it is what "native patterns for this"
selects.

Two consequences worth stating before anyone builds on it:

* **Ceph uses LUKS1, not LUKS2**, for breadth of distro support. `systemd-cryptenroll` — the whole
  FIDO2/TPM2 mechanism of D13.1 — requires **LUKS2**. So the OSD-encryption path and the MiOS-Cat
  portable-drive path are *different mechanisms that cannot share a token or a key*. Treating
  `[blade.storage].at_rest` and `[security.disk_encryption]` as one surface would be a category
  error.
* **Encryption must be enabled when an OSD is created.** An existing unencrypted OSD cannot be
  encrypted in place — the only path is adding encrypted OSDs and rebalancing. This is therefore a
  **day-0 decision for every Mini**, and shipping a Mini with unencrypted OSDs commits its operator
  to a data migration later.


## Consequences

**Enabling**

* Offload becomes a config overlay. A seat pointed at a blade is `[urls]` rewritten, nothing more.
* "local, localhost or remote" collapses into one mechanism: they are three values of the same URL.
* The blade registry gives the VRAM/admission machinery (`_BLADE_POOL`, `_ENDPOINT_BLADE`,
  `MULTIBLADE_ENABLE`) an SSOT to read, which it currently lacks.

**Costs and hazards**

* **A seat would have rolled itself back on every boot, and I said twice that it would not.** The
  first draft of this ADR predicted the rollback loop; the second "corrected" it on the grounds that
  `40-mios-ai-plane.sh` opens each probe with `systemctl is-enabled --quiet "$unit" || return 0`.
  That correction was wrong. **`is-enabled` reports installation, not whether a unit will start.**
  `Condition*` is evaluated at *start* time, so a capability-skipped unit is still enabled — and a
  Quadlet-generated unit reports `generated`, which also exits 0. On a seat the guard therefore does
  not fire: greenboot probes `mios-pgvector` and `mios-llm-light` on ports nothing is listening on,
  fails the required check, and hands `bootc` a bad boot.

  *Evidence level, stated honestly:* the units carry `[Install] WantedBy=` so Quadlet installs them,
  and `Condition*`-vs-enablement is documented systemd behaviour — but this container has no system
  bus and no man pages, so that half is reasoning rather than measurement. The fix does not depend on
  resolving it: the probe now asks **the same question the unit's own `ConditionPathExists` asks** —
  is the capability marker present in `/etc/mios/blade.d/`. Under the pessimistic reading that
  removes the rollback loop; under the optimistic one it replaces an accident with a design.
  `tests/test-greenboot-blade-guard.sh` exercises the real predicate against a fixture tree (no
  systemd required) and runs in CI; neutering the marker check turns it red. It degrades open when
  the blade resolver has not run at all, per Law 12.

* **`[greenboot].critical_services` is still read by nothing.** The check
  hardcodes its own four unit/port pairs. `MIOS_GREENBOOT_CRITICAL_SERVICES` is emitted by both
  `globals` twins and consumed by no shipped code — the same decorative-key failure as
  `[profile].role`, and it had already drifted: the SSOT lists three services, the check probes four
  (it adds `hermes`), and `check_greenboot` hardcoded the *check's* four rather than the *SSOT's*
  three, so the script and its gate agreed with each other while both ignored the source of truth.
  The gate now reads the SSOT; wiring the *probe* to it is what remains of T-314.
* **Whether a seat's "critical" may include reaching its blade is now a recorded choice**, not an
  implication: `[greenboot].blade_reachability_critical` defaults to `false`, so Law 12 holds by
  default (degrade open, never block boot) and an operator who wants a seat to fail its boot when
  its blade is unreachable opts in explicitly, in the SSOT, where the trade is visible.
* **Law 3 BOUND-IMAGES** symlinks every Quadlet image so it ships *with* the host. A seat that runs
  none of them still carries all of them. Either Law 3 gains a role-aware exception, or a seat is
  not actually smaller — only quieter.
* **Service identity is the port.** Two blades serving the same service collide in
  `_discover_portal_services()`, which dedupes by port. Either the portal service list moves to
  `[urls]`, or blades get a port offset — `[ports].stack_id` already computes `stack_id * 10000`
  and is the obvious candidate for a blade ordinal.
* **`Network=host` on a blade exposes every service** to anything that can route to it. A blade is
  only as safe as its mesh plus inbound auth; there is no per-service network boundary to attach a
  policy to.
* **Shared state is not shared identity.** Two seats on one pgvector collide on the `uid_alloc` /
  `gid_alloc` sequences and the RLS owner column. Either the blade is the identity authority, or
  seats keep local identity and rent only the vector store.

**Deliberately not decided here**

* Whether URLs gain a per-service host variable (`${MIOS_HOST_X}`) or are overridden whole. Whole-URL
  override needs no new machinery and is the default until a blade ordinal exists.
* Whether a seat may write to a blade's pgvector, and whose `[security.redact]` policy applies on
  the persist path when it does.
* Blade discovery. Static endpoints work today; `mios_gossip.py` has no transport under it (T-229).

## Rationale

The alternative — building a second image and a service-placement engine — was rejected because the
tree does not need one. `Network=host` already made every service address a real, routable address;
the only thing missing is a canonical name for each address and the discipline to use it. That is a
gate and a register, not an architecture.

Starting from naming would have been the mistake. The naming collision is real but it is
downstream: every mechanism above is identical whichever image ends up called *mini*.

This ADR's first draft read `[blades]` as empty and concluded the role axis was undecided. That was
an artifact of reading the plural key and not the singular one. Re-measured against the tree, the
role axis is the most finished mechanism in scope and the open work on it is subtraction — retire
`[profile]`, stop `role-apply` acting, generate the karg — not design. The unfinished axis is
addressing, which is Decision 1.
