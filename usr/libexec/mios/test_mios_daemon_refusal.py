# AI-hint: Standalone unit test for the mios-daemon refusal/fabrication detector after the NO-HARDCODE cutover. Proves the detector is MODEL-DRIVEN (the deleted refusal-patterns.txt English-regex PRE-FILTER no longer gates whether to even check): loads the hyphenated CLI via SourceFileLoader, stubs its single model choke (llm_chat) to assert (1) a "YES" verdict on a response with NO refusal-keyword text still records a refusal -- the judge is consulted on EVERY candidate, (2) a "NO" verdict records nothing, (3) an unreachable lane (empty llm_chat) and an unparseable verdict both DEGRADE-OPEN to None (skip, never fabricate, never fall back to a keyword list), and (4) mode != model disables the judge without consulting the model, and the deleted pattern loader/gate (_load_refusal_patterns / _refusal_res / REFUSAL_PATTERNS_FILE) is gone.
