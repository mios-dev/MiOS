"""mios-agents.service runs its ExecStartPre (mios-agents-firstboot.sh) as root,
and that script seeds code-server settings and an extension into
/var/lib/mios/agents -- the container's coder home, owned by uid 1000 per
tmpfiles.d/mios-agents.conf. Created as root, those paths leave code-server
(running as the home's owner) unable to write its own User/ state.

Positive control: seeding a uid-1000 scratch home as root leaves every seeded
path owned 1000:1000. Negative control: the pre-fix seeding (plain install -d,
install and cp as root) is planted in a scratch copy and the same check must
name a root-owned path. The script is sourced -- it returns before its build
step when sourced -- with its home, settings and extension sources pointed at
the scratch fixture.
