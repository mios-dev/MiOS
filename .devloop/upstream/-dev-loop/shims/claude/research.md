# /research (alias /rs): Upstream Dependency & Architecture Research

Analyze upstream changes before modifying codebase contracts.

Usage:
`/research <base_tag_or_sha> [upstream_tag_or_sha]`
Alias: `/rs <base> [upstream]`

## Execution Protocol

1. Query upstream git changes using `python3 scripts/research.py diff $ARGUMENTS`.
2. Inspect deleted files, changed signatures, and deprecated modules.
3. Generate `UPSTREAM_BRIEF.md` detailing breaking changes and necessary architectural adaptations.
