# MiOS ledger (handoff notes; newest last)

Each session appends one entry before it ends or compacts: status, done, next, blockers,
unverified. State lives on disk, not in a context window.

## 2026-09-16 · T-1018 stage conversions · status: partial

**Context that is not obvious from the tree.** Sixteen build stages dispatched to the Rust binary
with `command -v miosd`, a PATH lookup that cannot resolve at bake time — miosd installs to
`/usr/libexec/mios`, which nothing puts on PATH. So the Rust branch has never executed in a real
build and every bake silently used the bash fallback. Converting them one at a time, each proving
byte-parity before the fallback is deleted.

**Done:** 3 of 18 gates. `35-render-ports`, `42-chrony-render`, `43-nut-render`. Register
`[build.tool_dispatch].max_unreachable` 18 → 15.

**All three had real defects in the never-executed Rust path:**
- `render-ports` — a line scan, not a TOML parse, so comments containing `=` became environment
  variable names in `install.env`, one carrying a backtick pair that `bash source` reads as
  command substitution (Law 10).
- `render-chrony` — the same scan could not read a multi-line array, so `[network.ntp].servers`
  parsed empty and it SILENTLY substituted hardcoded `time.cloudflare.com` / `time.google.com`
  (Law 7), under a header claiming it was generated from SSOT.
- `render-nut` — byte-identical output, but `unwrap_or_default()` meant a nonexistent manifest
  rendered four default config files and exited 0.

**Next:** the conversion order is groups A–E (see the T-1018 body in `TASKS.md`). A background
audit of all fourteen remaining stages is running; its map supersedes the provisional order.

**Blockers:** none. The operator confirmed CI red is acceptable until all stages are done.

**Unverified:** no bake has been run. Every conversion is proved by offline output diffing, not by
a real build. The operator will run bakes and a CI bake job is planned (T-1028).

**Watch out for:** the `mios-resolver` binary must be built before a local gate run means anything
— `check_resolver_differential_parity` exits 0 when it is absent. That skip hid a real failure
this session until CI caught it.

## 2026-09-16 (later) · dev-loop v5 adopted; T-1022 closed · status: partial

**Baseline moved.** The drift gate is now **19 violations from SIX checks**, not 20 from seven.
`check_secret_handling` is green. Any future session comparing against "20 from seven" is using a
stale number.

**Done:** dev-loop v5.0.0 adopted (docs/DOD.md, this ledger, explicit-path staging, pre-commit
secrets scan). T-1022 closed as a false positive -- the two flagged files hold PEM *templates*,
not keys, and the check was matching a keyword rather than the property. Research report filed at
`docs/design/agentic-dev-scaffolding.md`; T-1029 and T-1030 filed from it.

**Next:** T-1018 stages 4..18. A background workflow is auditing all fourteen remaining stages'
Rust renderers in parallel; its map supersedes the provisional group order in the T-1018 body.

**Unverified:** still no bake. Every T-1018 conversion is proved by offline output diffing only.

**Traps this session walked into, so the next one does not:**
- `exit=$?` after a PIPE reports the pipe's status, not the command's. A negative control reported
  "exit=0" that way looks like a pass. Capture the exit inside a function.
- A heredoc that builds a regex with backslashes doubles them. Write the literal with `chr(92)` or
  a real file write, then GREP THE RESULT before trusting it.
- The tooling-Python ratchet has zero slack by design: adding any Python line requires removing
  one. Put rationale in the commit message, not in an eleven-line comment.

## 2026-09-16 (later still) · T-1031 + T-1032 — the gate was not running the build's Python · status: partial

**The single most important line in this ledger.** Until commit `0b803b65`, `automation/98-drift-checks.sh`
ran every one of the 209 checks on a **cached copy of a different Python interpreter** than
`sync-generated.sh`, `just`, CI and anything you type by hand. The copy lived at
`${TEMP:-/tmp}/mios-py-bin/python3`, was created once and never invalidated. On this host it was
Python **3.13.12**, dated the previous day; the system interpreter was **3.11.15**. Fixed: the shim
is Windows-only now (it no-ops wherever a real `python3` resolves) and is never cached.

**Consequence for anyone reading older sessions:** a gate result recorded before `0b803b65` was
produced by an interpreter nobody chose and nothing logged. It agrees with the corrected one on
today's tree — 19 violations, six checks, measured both ways — but that is luck.

**Baseline unchanged:** **19 violations from six checks**. `check_doc_refs_resolve` 11,
`check_docs_ratchet` 3, `check_unit_dependency_closure` 2, `check_db_seed_coverage` 1,
`check_module_test_coverage` 1, `check_no_duplicate_value_key` 1.

**Done:** T-1022 (secret-handling false positive, predicate narrowed to header+body), T-1031
(`tools/render-globals.py` did not parse below py3.12, which broke `sync-generated.sh` at step 2/6
and took the four downstream projections with it), T-1032 (the interpreter shim).

**Next:** T-1018 stages 4..18, pending the renderer-audit workflow's map.

**Traps this session walked into, so the next one does not:**
- **Reproducing a check's command in your shell is not reproducing the check.** A file that exits 1
  under `python3` gave rc=0 through the gate, and a commit message went out asserting the opposite
  before that was caught. Run it *through the harness*, or you are measuring a different subject.
- A pre-commit secrets scan that matches a bare `-----BEGIN ... KEY-----` flags **the source line of
  the regex that looks for keys**. Require the base64 body. The scanner used here lives in the
  session scratchpad and is validated against six controls; the durable version is
  `drift-checks.py secret-handling`, which now has the same predicate.
- `git add` of a derived file before `sync-generated.sh` completes stages a half-regenerated tree.
  Run the spine to exit 0 first, then stage explicit paths.
- Shrink-only ratchets with slack are not neutral: `shell_lines=38431/39903`, `ps_lines=22607/22618`,
  `tracked_files=3288/3344` all sit BELOW their ceilings. A ceiling above its measurement is
  accepted debt nobody is paying down — fold into T-1013/T-1021.

**Unverified:** still no bake. Every T-1018 conversion is proved by offline output diffing only.

## 2026-09-16 (evening) · the renderer audit landed; five live defects fixed · status: partial

**Baseline unchanged all session: 19 violations from six checks.** `check_doc_refs_resolve` 11,
`check_docs_ratchet` 3, `check_unit_dependency_closure` 2, `check_db_seed_coverage` 1,
`check_module_test_coverage` 1, `check_no_duplicate_value_key` 1. Every commit below held it
count-for-count.

**The 29-agent renderer audit returned** and is committed at
`docs/design/miosd-renderer-parity-audit.md`. Read its **coverage gaps** before building any
conversion gate from it: no auditor ran a real `podman build`, no SELinux-enforcing host existed,
and several stages were replayed through harnesses. Its **refuted claims** section is the most
useful part — every refutation was a harness artifact, never a fabricated observation.

**The sequencing rule is now evidence-backed.** `ENV PATH=/usr/libexec/mios:$PATH` would arm the
latent Rust defects in stages 75, 33, 34, 40, 51, 49, 88, 01 and 05 **in one bake**. Do not do it.
Convert per stage. Revised order: `build.sh` driver → 75 (done) → 76 → 33 → 34 → 01 → 85 → 49 →
88 → 44 → 40+51 as one commit → 05 → the hollow-check gate.

**Done since the last entry:** T-1022, T-1031, T-1032, T-1033, T-1018 stage 4 (75-kargs),
the audit filing (T-1034..T-1041), T-1034 (partial), T-1039, T-1038 (partial).

**What the conversions keep finding.** Four stages converted, four real defects, every one
invisible for as long as the dispatch has been dead:
- `35-render-ports` — TOML comments became env var names, one carrying a backtick pair (Law 10).
- `42-chrony-render` — a multi-line array unreadable by line scan, silently substituting
  hardcoded `time.cloudflare.com` / `time.google.com` (Law 7).
- `43-nut-render` — byte-identical, but rendered four default files from a nonexistent manifest.
- `75-kargs-render` — **deleted `rd.driver.pre=vfio-pci` and `kvm-intel.nested=1` from the kernel
  command line**, exit 0, under a header claiming SSOT provenance.

**Traps this session walked into, so the next one does not:**
- **`$?` after a pipe reports the pipe's status.** Written down in this ledger this morning, walked
  into again this evening (I read `bake-budget` as exit 0 when it correctly returns 1). Capture the
  status in a variable on the same line, or inside a function.
- **Sourcing a shell library inside a pipeline puts it in a SUBSHELL** and every variable it sets is
  lost. This is how "2641 of 2655 `MIOS_*` are never exported" became a finding in the audit, and
  how I reproduced it a second time. `source X | head` measures nothing.
- **Reproducing a check's command in your shell is not reproducing the check.** The drift gate runs
  its own interpreter and its own environment; run it through the harness.
- **Touching `automation/build.sh` promotes it to lint-shell's warning tier**, which surfaces nine
  pre-existing shellcheck findings. Budget for them or do not touch the file.
- **Ceilings above their measurement are findings.** Both new gates treat slack as a violation.

**Unverified, still:** no bake has been run, by anyone, at any point. Every conversion is proved by
offline output diffing and negative controls only.

## 2026-09-16 (late) · the bake's own gate was reporting 55 passes it never computed · status: partial

**Read this before trusting any `miosd drift-check` output from before `5d66f508`.** 54 of 77
`Check::run` impls took `_ctx`, never read the tree, and returned a constant `Verdict::Pass` with
a message claiming verification. Pointed at a directory that does not exist the suite reported
**"55 passed"**. `Containerfile:103` runs it at every bake. They now say
`Verdict::Skip("NOT IMPLEMENTED: ...")` and are registered shrink-only at `[drift.unimplemented]`,
gated by `mios-gate drift-stubs`.

**What the native suite actually verifies: 18 things, not 73.** Real tree now reads
`18 passed, 1 failed, 55 skipped`.

**That one failure is real and was invisible** — `check_backfill_coverage: Table 'system_logs' has
'emb vector' but is not in PK_MAP or _BACKFILL_EXEMPT`, failing at every bake under fifty-five
claims that could not fail. Filed T-1042. And exactly one check still passes against a
nonexistent root (`check_pipeline_numbering` calls an empty set dense) — filed T-1043 as the
template for auditing the other 20 ctx-reading checks.

**CI gave its first clean verdict of the session** on `f4424e50`: 9 of 10 steps green, only the
drift-gate tier failing, with **7 negative-test failures, down from the baseline 8**. Every one is
`check_X failed on the unmutated tree` for the six standing-red checks. Nothing new is ours.

**Gate baseline: still 19 violations from six checks**, count-for-count, across all 14 commits.

**Three shrink-only registers now exist and all three treat a ceiling above its measurement as a
violation:** `[build.tool_dispatch]` (14), `[build.phases].unregistered` (1),
`[drift.unimplemented]` (54), plus `[security.credential_literals]` which now pins VALUES not keys.

**Four decisions are with the operator** and are blocking, not optional: registering
`55-native-build.sh` (or dropping its `/usr/bin` symlink); stage 34's acceptance test inverting
because the Rust path is the correct one; the 44-port three-spelling collapse that
`naming-unification.md` already decided and nobody executed; and which of the two shipping
bake-plan implementations owns stage 85.

**Trap added:** `$?` after a pipe reports the pipe's status — walked into for the THIRD time today,
on `mios-gate` output. It is in this ledger twice now. Capture the status without a pipe.
