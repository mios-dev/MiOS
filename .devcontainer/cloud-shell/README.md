<!-- AI-hint: How to install and launch the portable MiOS Dev Container from Google Cloud Shell and Oracle Cloud Shell, which do not apply devcontainer.json on their own. -->
# MiOS Cloud Shell bootstrap

GitHub Codespaces automatically consumes `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json` and
runs its lifecycle commands. Google Cloud Shell and Oracle Cloud Shell do not
automatically apply a repository Dev Container configuration when a repository
is opened, so install the portable launcher once from the MiOS checkout:

```bash
bash .devcontainer/cloud-shell/bootstrap.sh install
```

Open a new shell, then run:

```bash
mios-cloud-shell up
```

The launcher installs `@devcontainers/cli` beneath persistent
`$HOME/.local`. On Oracle Cloud Shell it starts the rootless Podman API socket
and exposes it through `DOCKER_HOST` for the Dev Containers CLI. On Google
Cloud Shell it uses the preinstalled Docker engine. Both routes select the
portable `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json` profile.

Use the privileged `.devcontainer/artifact-builder/devcontainer.json` only on
a trusted, self-managed builder host. Cloud Shell providers do not promise the
privileges needed for `bootc-image-builder` disk artifacts.

## Claude Code cloud environment

A Claude Code cloud session runs on a fixed Ubuntu VM, so MiOS reaches it as
the same dev image Codespaces builds: `claude-code-cloud.sh` builds
`.devcontainer/Containerfile` (FROM the machine-os mirror every MiOS image
shares) from MiOS `main` under rootful podman, runs the devcontainer
lifecycle, and installs `mios-dev`, which enters that image with the session's
checkouts mounted at the same paths. The generic projection and the dev-loop
plugin come from the dev-loop toolkit; this file supplies only MiOS's values.

In the environment's settings (environment menu, Edit):

Setup script:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mios-dev/MiOS/main/.devcontainer/cloud-shell/claude-code-cloud.sh -o /tmp/mios-claude-code-cloud.sh && bash /tmp/mios-claude-code-cloud.sh
exit 0
```

Environment variables:

```
CLAUDE_CODE_PLUGIN_DIRS=/opt/dev-loop
```

Every `FEDORA_*` value has a default in the script; set one in the environment
variables only to override it. A cold first build can exceed the setup budget:
past `FEDORA_SETUP_BUDGET_S` the lifecycle is deferred, `mios-dev` says so, and
`bash /opt/dev-loop-fedora/cloud-fedora-setup.sh --lifecycle` applies it.
